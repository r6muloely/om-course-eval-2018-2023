F2023-28,2023,Fall,change,I would do nothing differently.
F2023-28,2023,Fall,change,"I would not make every section of the course watch videos of lectures instead of in person or synchronous zoom lectures. The professor wasn't even in the video lectures so you are just watching his screen and hearing his voice, so it is not very engaging. I personally learn better in a synchronous class which is why I picked a section that was supposed to meet online on zoom and was disappointed when I realized all of the lectures were recordings. "
F2023-28,2023,Fall,change,Work on problems in class to best learned the materials 
F2023-28,2023,Fall,change,"I took the online version, where we had a scheduled zoom time. However, this was not lecture, he made our class time his office hours. "
F2023-28,2023,Fall,change,"Bring it back to in person. the videos were very long and boring, and I did not get a good grasp on the class."
F2023-28,2023,Fall,growth,He allows us to work at our own pace and gives us time to learn the material.

F2023-28,2023,Fall,growth,N/A
F2023-28,2023,Fall,growth,Romulo posted easy–to–understand videos that encouraged critical thinking and allowed me to learn the course topics effectively. The homeworks were extremely well planned out to encourage student learning of the topics. He was always helpful during office hours and made sure to help you understand the course materials. Romulo is one of the best teachers I have had at Rutgers and made a challenging topic easy to understand.

F2023-28,2023,Fall,other,If a course is going to be asynchronous it should be stated as such when registering for classes. Some homework problems also did  not correlate very well with what we were watching in lectures.

who try hard and do all the work but still don't do so well on the tests."
F2023-24,2023,Fall,other,"If the class was asynchronous, then make that known on WebReg. I do not like the professor's ""system"" of recording lectures and

F2023-23,2023,Fall,growth,– always providing office hours and opportunity to ask questions
F2023-23,2023,Fall,growth,"He allows us to review course material and upload it in canvas. This has been helpful as I can rewatch or rewind the video as much as I
have to. Also, he encourages us to come to class if we have any questions about the class material we are learning. This provides us the
opportunity to dive deeper into the material and ask questions if we need clarification. It provides class time for us to go over
anything we do not understand. I have gone to him multiple times already throughout the semester and he took his time to explain the
material to me. He also allows us to come in to ask questions during any of the sections he teaches. This has been more convenient as I
can go during the time that best works for me and I can see him multiple times in a day if I need help with something."

F2023-22,2023,Fall,change,Make it easier or guided learning because we basically teach it to ourselves
F2023-22,2023,Fall,change,"I would most likely cut down on a few topics, as I believe it is a bit difficult to try to comprehend many topics throughout the semester."
F2023-22,2023,Fall,change,I will assign more small assignments to decrease the percentage of each homework.
F2023-22,2023,Fall,change,"The only thing I would say is that the Professor took a long time to answer emails, but that’s understandable because of how many
sections he has. Maybe having a TA help with emails or just spend more time on them."
F2023-22,2023,Fall,change,"Rather than having four homework quizzes, complete two or three longer format exams."
F2023-22,2023,Fall,growth,"He helped me realize this class is challenging. Not his fault though, the class is just real hard"
F2023-22,2023,Fall,growth,He always encourages questions and always wants to make sure we understand the material.

F2023-21,2023,Fall,best,I liked being able to work with both math and Excel to understand different ways to approach problems and optimize solutions.
F2023-21,2023,Fall,change,"I would have in–person review days before every homework to not only answer student questions but also repackage the necessary
information for that homework into quick references and tips to remember. I would also have more assignments besides the 4
homeworks and final to allow for group/individual non–timed work and cushion for grades."

general, while the lectures helped me understand content, in order to apply those concepts to the homework, I would have wanted
more homework practice problems."

F2022-21,2022,Fall,best,I liked the asynch aspect. I liked how he gave us 7 hours to complete the hw.

F2022-21,2022,Fall,best,there were a lot of examples and practice problems provided

problems as if they were puzzles."

F2022-21,2022,Fall,change,I would have made more assignments to lower the weight of each
F2022-21,2022,Fall,change,I would have more in–person lectures or recitations.
F2022-21,2022,Fall,change,"Host in person lectures, difficult learning everything online."
F2022-21,2022,Fall,change,"If I were teaching this course, I would provide more examples that are similar to the ones in homework/exams so that students can
get a good idea of what to expect and how to properly prepare for them."
F2022-21,2022,Fall,change,I would provide extra credit opportunities for students.

lectures. Each lecture was easy to follow and understand, and I felt like learning more after each part."
F2022-21,2022,Fall,growth,He provided real–world examples where operations management could be used.
F2022-21,2022,Fall,growth,I had to learn to manage an asynchronous class when I did not sign up for one. The class structure was a challenge for me.

F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,I like how it is very structured
F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,"Prof provides excel workbooks to complement lectures, which allowed to me follow along with him; helpful in gaining experiences
practicing the LP solver and solving of models in general."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,The use of internet
F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,I liked that the course did not have any group project.

F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,I really like the lecture videos and the discussion forum for students to ask questions. Also everything was very well organised!
F2022-20,2022,Fall,best,Professor’s enthusiasm and knowledge.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"I would have made it a hybrid class, where the in–person portion would be a very short class that would quickly review everything
that was in the videos."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"Nothing really, I thought it was good"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,I wish the class was in person.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"I would 100 percent not have 18 videos that are 30mins – 1 hour long and give it to my students and literally saying good luck
learning by yourself. It's the way I learn and how i can make my brain function. I would actually have videos that are short and no
mistakes in the videos so that everyone isn't confused or just come to class to teach it"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"I think I will post one or two assignments, or give some extra credit opportunities just in case some students get a bad grade on the
previous assignments."

F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,Absolutely nothing
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"I signed up for an in–person course because I do not really like the hybrid/asynchronous course designs so I really expected this to
be a hands–on in–person class. I don't like how the course is structured by only making the in–person class a question and
answer session. I do not appreciate just watching pre–recorded videos instead of actually being taught the material."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,Not a thing!
F2022-20,2022,Fall,change,"I would reorganize the canvas modules to make more friendly when it comes to navigating. I would also make the deadlines very
clear to the students so they are able to plan ahead. Finally I would teach the class in person as the course material is very dense"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,He gives us a lot of examples in order for us to test ourselves on our own
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"Prof includes a lot of supplementals to add to lecture and understanding of concepts, which helped me in the early stages of the
course."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"I think in some ways yes but in reality you can't have multiple videos of the chapters and expect everyone to learn it that way.
Everyone learns different weather that's through 30 min multiple videos or even hour long ones which i certainly don't learn that way
or actually teaching it in front of students."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,hard to reach
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,Having the complimentary material is massive for helping further understand the course content.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,Homework assignments that encouraged learning and studying.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely was always available to help or answer any question when it arose but allowed for flexibility and freedom in going
through the material which was very helpful. This encouraged my intellectual growth and progress in this class."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"The asynchronous nature of this course was counterproductive to learning. I thought the class layout was confusing, and did not
help me learn whatsoever."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,positive attitude during recorded lectures helped me stay positive while studying
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo lectures have been the most detailed I have seen and made even difficult lessons easy to comprehend and
created great ways for a us to practice with him by including excel templates for problems. Great Professor overall nothing I feel he
needs to improve on!"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,Great professor! Very enthusiastic about the material.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,growth,"I believe in organization, this course was very poorly thought out and executed. I don't know if this is actually the case but the course
feels like it was slapped together at the last minute. The course is"

F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,"No other comments I hope you take consideration in the future that some students learn different then just sitting at a computer all
day watch long videos. I think you have good intentions on being a great professor in the near future but I think maybe a realization
has to come in mind that, ""hey maybe I should change the format of how I teach. "" thank you for everything!"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,The only comment I would say is the extra credit opportunity.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,Thank you for a great semester.
F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,"I really like the professor when I interacted with him, but the class structure just does not work for me. I think asynchronous courses
were only acceptable during the pandemic; now it just feels like a lesser class compared to my others at RBS."
F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,"Overall, I think I learned a lot from this course and very much enjoyed this class as it was hands on but definitely not boring with the
lecture videos"
F2022-20,2022,Fall,other,Great course!
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The detailed online lectures were incredibly helpful and great resources to look back on at any time whenever I was confused.

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,recitation which clarifies any concept I am struggling to understand

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The course always for flexibility as you can watch the videos at any time.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"I really like the structure of the class–– if you want to get ahead you can. Also, the TAs for this course are very helpful."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"Appreciated the lectures being optional and there if you had any questions about the class overall. Respected your time and had it
so that if you were busy on certain days or just couldn't you weren't forced to come."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,I like that there were a lot of different practice examples available to us.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"The flexibility, the work isn't constant or consistency, the opportunity as a class to do better and pass."

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"I liked the independent nature of this course, as it promoted self–studying and taught the students how to learn new skills on their
own while utilizing key resources. I also found this course to be one of the most useful courses I have taken so far because as a
finance major, linear and non–linear programming is used a lot in corporate finance and investment management, as well as other
careers focused on business."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The asynchronous
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The Canvas course page was very organized and could be used as an example for other professors.

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"This course offered a lot of freedom. As you were able to attend different recitations if by any chance you weren't able to attend yours.
Lectures were also online which was good as you would be able to look back at the material anytime you'd like."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,I liked learning different ways to use excel and applying it to the math we were learning.

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,using excel
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,I enjoy our ability to navigate through it ourselves.

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"This course was not a struggle to follow the material based on the way the class was taught. In the past some of my courses were
taught in a manner that made the class tough to follow the course material."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,I liked that the course consisted of recorded lectures.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"The lack of pointless ""busy–work"""
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"It gave us as students personal autonomy and let us go at our own pace. It also gave detailed videos explaining all material with
plenty of examples to help students fully understand the material."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,I liked how the class was conducted asynchronously but the professor was always available to help at his office hours
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,Everything is online
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,"I greatly enjoyed the material in this class, I found it very engaging and interesting. Professor Ely also provided plenty of extra
material to help his students study."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,Good examples and explanations during lectures
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The professor
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,The structure of the course
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,Asynchronous
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,Learning more about excel
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,Excel
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,best,video lectures
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would make it more of a physical learning course then mostly online
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would make less mistakes in the lecture videos, as it seemed to throw me off whenever there were different or incorrect answers"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,in the videos.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Nothing specific, I like how this course was taught. We were given all resources to help us."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Absolutely nothing.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would not do anything differently
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would try to engage the class more and get students more involved in solving the problems.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Maybe check in with the students more often.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Have more opportunities to learn in person.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I wouldn’t do anything differently. Having access to video lectures, recitations, and office hours was a great aspect of this course and"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would keep it the same.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,More group activities
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would change the homework around. In the lectures, we do not learn conceptual questions, only how to do the math. Half of the
homework questions are conceptual, with no math being involved. Since we do not learn anything conceptual throughout the
videos, those questions will almost always be gotten wrong."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,not use videos as the only form of teaching
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Nothing much, only a simple thing which is the mini errors that are under the video links which I sometimes forget there was a
comment when watching the video."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would maybe try to make the lectures a bit shorter because sometimes it can be too much.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would not have ""none of the above"" as an option on exams it makes the students feel like they just solved the problem wrong and
guess even though they knew what they were doing, I also feel like the canvas could have been more organized and possibly
separated the content by weeks so it was easier to find the lectures that we had to watch."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,More engagement assignments
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,make it more interactive
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I don’t know
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Add more grades and make a C a 60 instead of a 70
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,make videos shorter
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would not do anything different.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would give more homework but worth less value.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would add more structure to the class. There were no actual in–person lectures. I would have at least one in–person lecture that
students could attend."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Have a different approach in teaching during recitations. Have students physically do more on–hands practice to see if they actually
understand the material. Doing just note–taking doesn't help teach the students as well and just has the student copy and forget.
Having us do more practice problems that the TA doesn't do but instead we work on first would help out a lot in this regard"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Offer either in–person or video–d lectures
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would lecture in person
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would have had a required in–person class day once per week as I personally prefer the hybrid approach,"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,None
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Maybe assign some small homework for more grades and practice.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I think the canvas page could be set up a little bit more efficiently. I think it would be helpful to have a module for each lecture, or
each week, to keep us more on track and find the material more accessible."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,–
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would make the canvas page more organized and have a different section for each lecture
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Have more required in person learning with examples and not an abundance of lectures on canvas
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing really.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Have in–person lectures be the main form of learning, while providing the online lectures as additional support."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would go more in–depth on how to actually build and structure the models in excel. The professor provided model templates
depending on the problem, but I found it much more engaging to actually build the model in Excel from scratch and structure it in the
way that I prefer. Providing more guidance on this is something I would do differently."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"If I were teaching this course, I would organize the modules more and explain some of the material more thoroughly."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"shorten the lectures, slightly too long."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would give more, smaller assignments. Your whole grade being comprised of 4 assignments and 1 final ensures that you can
make very few mistakes if you are aiming for a satisfactory grade. In addition, the TAs should take attendance in recitations and
actually teach during them. In my section, after 1–2 sessions in a row where the TA had no lesson/review prepared, the entire
recitation section stopped attending."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Have true, in–person lectures"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,No
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would limit the amount of information posted in each module. The modules have around 10 to 20 documents within each one,
which can be overwhelming."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,make lectures live online with mandatory attendance
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Instead of just homeworks, have practice quizzes that let us prepare for the graded assignments."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Although lectures were done online and recorded. I would suggest that the professor done a review lecture of the materials before
assigning homework."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"lecture videos were very long, also hard to navigate (split into lots of parts, didn't know what was covered in what part) –– if they were
shorter, more concise and better organized, that would be very helpful. like instead of videos 1 2 3 4, it told you what was included in
there (explaining xyz concept, doing xzy problem)"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would update my videos I publish
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would add more assignments with low weightage rathe just 5 graded assignments for the entire semester. I feel this would allow
the students more leeway if they don't do well on one or two of the assognments."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would probably provide more practice problems so students have more resources to prepare for tests!
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Do lectures in person. Make attendance mandatory.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would have class time made for teaching rather than a time to ask questions about work.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Involve more group activities so that students can be exposed to different perspectives and ways of learning
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would add a couple more assignments to pad the grades so that the HW's were not weighed so heavily.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I felt that the lectures were too long sometimes and I understand that there is a lot of material to go through but I felt that if the
lectures were already really long then incorporating questions into the videos that way it shows if the students are comprehending
the material or not."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"The final was 40% of our total grade, which is a bit much (pretty much a pass/fail) if you don't do good on it. I say give us another
homework assignment and make it 15%–20% of our grade, and then make the final 25% percent. Hence, it gives students more
relief if they don't do as well as they would have liked."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would provide weekly homework.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would add more in–person sessions rather than keep it through online videos.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I wish that the Professor had actually held class. I was under the assumption that this class would be taught in person and that we
would meet each week. He simply put the recorded lectures on one long page on Canvas. It was not organized in the slightest. The
page was filled with random tabs everywhere and they did not assist me at all. Additionally, the TA was clearly very disorganized and
never finished what he was meant to teach. I found it far more beneficial to learn on my own, with my own resources."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"Nothing, I would keep class the same"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"The amount of material published on canvas can be a little intimidating. I would try to make the published documents a little more
concise regarding how many files are featured."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,the grading system is a bit mediocre. Also the hw exams were a bit weirdly structured
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would not do anything differently.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,More HW (quizzes) so they are less impactful if you do poorly
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,All online meetings
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I could not teach this course
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I am not sure.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing he did great
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would be more active inthe Discussions module in answering students' questions
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Have a few more assignments to make up the final grade.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"I would potentially organize canvas a tiny bit clearer, even though the Professor has it laid out fairly well right now."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,I would have more interactive teaching and individual help
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,"have more small assignments (quizzes, homework, etc), also actually lecture during lecture time and not have students just watch
videos and teach themselves. This is not supposed to be an asynchronous class if I wanted to take an asynchronous class I would
have signed up for one and I find it very inconsiderate because knowing myself and my learning style means that I know in–person
classes work better for me and that is what I signed up for."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,More organized canvas
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,Better recitations + more assignments to help learn material
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,change,nothing
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Finally a professor who understands how different students learn and is able to provide those methods
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He provided videos and personal assistance within classes for questions and help on any assignment or hw
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He has been a delightful teacher and makes learning fun.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He always thoroughly explained topics throughout his lecture videos and was accessible outside of class as well when I needed
help. He also provided additional resources that are not needed but further help develop a better understanding of the material."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"I really liked the way Professor Ely made it easy to navigate the Canvas page. He always gave very detailed information about the
homeworks which was very helpful."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He had encouraged me to try my very hardest as a student.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"I appreciate that we ultimately are able to learn the material on our own time and we can work on time management skills by doing
so."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,I would say to go into depth on how this information can be used on a job site
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Professor Ely helped me understand the course content through assisted walk–thru videos to explain each problem thoroughly.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He gave us many ways to reach out if we were ever lost or confused.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,I would prefer to have weekly in person class sessions rather than having to rely on the recorded lectures posted on canvas.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,N/A
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"This course helped me grow intellectually by understanding difficult concepts through video lectures and by breaking each problem
down slowly to answer any possible questions that can come up."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Very helpful lectures
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,taught us new concepts to apply them in practical situations
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He was a great, and effective professor"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"This class was really informative, and I learned a lot about the subject."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,H made me enjoy linear programming
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"You could just tell he really cared about about operations management and he was really nice. It made his lectures easier to take
in."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Less fluff in videos
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,The videos that were provided during each week are very straightforward and go through problems in a step–by–step manner.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely provides detailed lectures and is very accommodating and helpful when you need it. He has encouraged my
intellectual growth by enhancing my excel skills that will help me in the future."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"I think that he definitely encouraged learning and i do not think he could have done a better job in that area, the only thing I feel like
could have been made easier for us was to just have a more organized canvas that separated the content by weeks so it was
easier to find the lectures that we had to watch."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He is a very nice professor. He helps set up the class to do well by providing pre–recorded material and it is up to the student to
watch the material and learn it at their leisure. He is fair when it comes to the class as a whole by giving students opportunities at
the end to do work for extra credit. The class itself is challenging but the professor gives students enough flexibility and chances to
pass the course."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"I believe that the structure of being able to show up to classes when available helped me a lot as without that my schedule would
have had a lot more trouble fitting together."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"time management, making time to review lectures and take notes outside of my other classes"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,put more grades in the system so students can have a way to make up their grade. Also make a 60 a C instead of a 70
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,by providing great videos and help!
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He teaches the material very well and does not stress students with a large amount of work.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,The professor encouraged learning the material on your own time which allowed to learn at my own pace.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Cannot answer this question too well, as most of my experience in this class comes from the TA, not Romulo. Barely went to any
lectures, so wouldn't know too much about his teaching style and methods. I can say that his course at least encourages me to be
more independent and responsible with setting up dates and times to go to him personally and to read off of slides on my own time"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,The online lectures and example problems are a good tool for asynchronous learning.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He always has office hours for students to ask for help and encourages students to go to office hours.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo gave us freedom during the class to help us learn in a way that is easiest for each individual student. He
encourages us to engage with the material so that we can understand it to the fullest."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He has provided enough resources and information, online and in–person, for me to succeed"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He used interesting real–world examples
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,provides numerous resources
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Ely's enthusiasm for the content incentivizes learning.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"This course pushed me to self–study a lot more than other classes, preparing me for my future when I have to learn new skills
independently. He provided ample amounts of resources in order to understand the complex topic at hand fully and also made
himself and the TAs available whenever students needed help. Overall, his teaching methods really promoted independence and
allowed students to work at their own pace."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo was always very responsive and had lots of office hours. He also sent a lot of reminders for us not to miss
assignments"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,The professor encouraged my intellectual growth and progress by helping me better understand excel and the logistics behind it.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Great dude
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,SElf learning and self motivation
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Great lecture with a lot of office hours
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Professor is so great and kind in teaching this class. He is great.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Did not really encourage growth
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,The manner in which he taught the course helped me take more accountability and develop better study habits.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Through offering office hours and recorded material.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,This course has taught me how to work on excel and how to use formulas on excel. The material of this course will come in handy
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,later on in the future.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,This course has encouraged me to learn more about the way businesses operate.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Being able to learn the material solely on your own.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"The way the class was run, is not my cup of tea. However the professor does provide enough resources, videos, and practice
problems to prepare for HW and exams"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"I think the addition of additional practice problems that we can do on our own or assignments to review over material more
frequently could help in retaining the information."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo Neves Ely effectively provided all the necessary resources required for learning and taught extremely well. He
makes hard concepts understandable through his engaging lectures and I really appreciate that! It has certainly allowed me to grow
and progress"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Because the course mainly relied on self–learning, the class wasn't vert encouraging in terms of intellectual growth and progress."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,By providing extensive supplementary material that I could use to strengthen my learning.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He has proven that the material can have real world application and shown that he is interested in the material himself, which has
encouraged me to dig deeper into the material."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Professor Ely answered the questions he was given.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He showed heavy interest in each topic he taught us.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Holding multiple extra help sessions and encouraging students to email him with any questions that they had.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Taught some unique examples of operations issues.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,NA
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He has provided multiple resources and gives any information that is required or may seem confusing.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Professor encouraged intellectual growth by creating a self–paced environment. This was helpful because he gave us plenty of
time to complete the assignments and it allowed us to learn at out own pace."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"N/A the class was good, just not the subject for me"
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Always encourages coming to office hours and is always there to help any students with extra help.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Positive and equally fair to everyone.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"He is always available for questions, and provides many resources to assist students."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,the course has enlightened me about the math processes going into operations and logistics
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,"Very engaging and nice person. Cares about his students and wants us all to succeed. Is very clear when teaching and provides
many examples that are helpful and thought–out."
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,it hasn't
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,Everything is recorded so it's easy for me to go back and relook at notes.
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,He is kind and makes sure we have enough material to learn and perform well on the tests
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,growth,gave me more insight into the uses of excel
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,it was darn swell
F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,It was one of the best classes I have taken

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,I feel like it was all fair.

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,Thx

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,N/A

F2022-largeclass,2022,Fall,other,"Having signed up and paid for a class that is in person from a certain time to a certain time, it was very demotivating that in order to
be allowed to attend those classes, you would have to sign up for them every week. You should not be required to sign up for a

seems unnecessary, you might as well make it no time restriction, which gives students more options to take breaks when taking
the homework assignments and possibly can promote students to do half the questions one day and the rest the following day or

The videos are too long if you are using the 1 hour & half hour period of class. I would divide the videos into sections which can be done withing the specified time and put on the modules that way in the relevant weeks. That way it is structured and easier to follow. Too much information is an overload and can make a person give up when you are not getting it.

Professor was good enough to give all the materials required for the class which was recorded but for a student like myself who
has issues with anything related with figures, it was tough trying to understand the material from using the videos. The book was
helpful it answered some of my questions. It was difficult to keep up and not being able to ask questions on the go."

F2022-23,2022,Fall,growth,"Some questions on our hws were not in the lectures and had to teach myself for the questions you didn’t talk about. It would be
easier if you would have study guides for the hw so students could do better to know what will be on he hws. Also I have tried to
email and haven’t gotten an email back. Emailing is the only way to reach out to so it can be hard to contact you. Thank you though

week. The professor usually gave us two weeks to watch a lecture, which was plenty of time to watch the videos and solve any
exercise problems. The homeworks were also fair, we had plenty of time to solve them"

office hours or attending a recitation."

way we can better keep track of the lectures we already watched. And maybe have set deadlines on each lectures so students can
keep track of their progress in the course.
Also, it would be helpful to have a separate module specifically for complementary materials. There's just so many links on the
canvas page that it becomes too overwhelming."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,"I would actually teach in person and help the students with their difficulties instead of using the class size as an excuse to not help
students."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,"On canvas, I would aim to keep the modules tab (where all the lectures/notes are) a bit more organized. It got quite messy, and
organizing it all together would definitely increase efficiency to me."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,More recitation times and more reference to refer to on the material for students that have busy schedules.
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,i would not teach the course asynchronously and teach it in person
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,final should be online if lectures are online
S2022-21,2022,Spring,change,"organize the lecture videos into one video per lecture not through the box and not with so many links, it is overwhelming and
discouraging. The class was said to be in person and was then converted to asynchronous which is harder to learn on your own

S2022-21,2022,Spring,growth,"in his lecture videos, he made the topics we learned about easy to understand since he thoroughly explained his knowledge to us.
Lectures were well organized by topic and this helped me know what I should be learning through each video"
S2022-21,2022,Spring,growth,"So my section was asynchronous, so that meant the professor just have us pages of reference of the material but the explanation of
the material of each topic is not detailed enough. There were lots of times that I was confused and I could not make it to the other
recitations or even the office hours. The only thing that helped me through this course was my study group."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,growth,"His passion for the subject is reflected in may ways. One of those ways is that he over explains things. This caused a bit of
confusion throughout lectures because he would lose his point or took a while to say the point and therefore making lectures a bit
longer than needed or simply lost my focus (focus necessary to be engaged in an online lecture) other than that he is really a
passionate and great professor."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,growth,"He allowed me to go back to videos on canvas and relearn topics that I may not have fully understood the first time around which

S2022-21,2022,Spring,growth,"he encourages us to do the lecture problems along with him on excel that way we get practice and this shows how he engages
students to get involved with the course even though it is an online lecture."

S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,"My only negative comment about this class would be the way the final was set up. I am ok with doing it online or in person because I
feel well prepared, and the decision to make it in person makes sense since its supposed to be an in person class, but it was not.
Even though the professor gave us the opportunity to come during actual class time, it would be more like office hours since all the
material we needed was already published on canvas so its not like we really had choice to attend live lectures."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,No help from this class at all
S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,"The execution of the course was bad but the professor was open to discussions even though there were lots of problems here and
there."
S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,"lectures seemed a little repetitive and prolonged at times, it would be easier to get through if the information was presented a little
more concisely"
S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,it was unfair to give students such short notice of final exam being in person
S2022-21,2022,Spring,other,"The recitations should be recorded especially since my section did not even have a recitation and we were allowed to attend other

S2022-20,2022,Spring,change,Continue to teach in the online format
S2022-20,2022,Spring,change,"I think the way the professor can improve this course is definitely by being hands–on –– what was supposed peerson class turned into a completely asynchrous class but didn't lose the difficulty aspect. As a result it felt myself about the topic rather than being taught which isn't ideal because we pay for these classes. Making it in–person would be
the approach."

S2022-20,2022,Spring,growth,Professor Ely went in–depth in lectures to discuss problems and that helps understand how to solve problems for exams.

hours for reinforcement. I went into the course worried I would not succeed and truly had no interest in content. However, Ely

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"I would add some additional things to be graded on. There are only 4 homework and each has not many questions. I don't think
getting 1 multiple choice question wrong should be almost 2% of your total grade. There should be other supplementary
assignments that contribute to your grade as well to dilute the weight of the homeworks."

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"I'd probably make more homework assignments. I liked the overall 4 hw's but if there were 6 then it allows for more wiggle room in

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"I would register the course as an online asynchronous course if it is an online asynchronous course. I registered for an in person
course at Livingston yet the first class he told us it was all online. I think the professor didn't do this with bad intentions but I Dont
think he realizes how much this messes a student up. To sum up: if the class is in person, teach it in person. If you want to teach a
class as asynchronous, make sure to register it as asynchronous on webreg. Students need to know this because it changes their
decision on the class."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,make lectures a bit more concise or put lecture about 1 ppt into one 2 hr lecture

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"the course was advertised as being synchronous and was then switched to asynchronous which was something I wanted to avoid
because I do not do well with learning through asynchronous instruction. this is a core class for the business school and my major
and I wish I had the instruction that I needed to grasp the material."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,I would most likely teach this course the same way.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"Teach IN PERSON, not prerecorded 20 minute videos for the week.
More personal work work to balance overall grades

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,Keep this the same but probably offer students more extra credit opportunities.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,I would make the in person classes mandatory so that it encourages more learning
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,I would focus more on teaching people how to use excel
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,Follow the posted syllabus.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,change,"Certain other classes offered both synchronous lectures in addition to pre–recorded videos from past semesters. Having a greater

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,I think having in–person lectures to cover material vs. Q&A style might work better for some students
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Learned how to prioritize workload by constantly uploading new lectures.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"His video lectures were very engaging, informational, and easy to follow. He made a complicated subject matter much more

something that may seem ""boring"" at first."

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Mr. Romulo kept his class engaged through his passion for the class and the material being taught.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,What he taught made me rethink a lot of the math that I had done in the past and taught me many new ways to look at problems.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"He gave us the freedom to learn on our own time. As well, when talking to him at lectures, he would always expand on why what he
was teaching for the week important in terms of its real–world applications (regardless of what field you aspire to go into)."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Very organized lecture cycle.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Great teacher
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"Although this class was supposed to be taught in person. Professor Ely has changed the course to a fully online course. This is terrible, it seemed as if he was lazy and just wanted to use his pre recorded videos he had over COVID. He did not host one single in person lecture and I would never take this course again."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,The combination of online courses and offline courses give students great opportunity to gain progress.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I believe that the course has encouraged my intellectual growth and progress through understanding key aspects of the course
through recorded lectures and videos, as well as asking the professor questions."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Romulo Neves Ely was a good teacher.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,I became more interested in the topics shown during lectures and on exams
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I was enlightened in a topic that I did not know much about. I am now much more interested in the study of operations and its
mathematical elements."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Romulo Neves Ely could have mentioned how our class concepts connect to projects in real companies
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I met with Professor Ely once, and I could tell he was a genuine person who was passionate about the topic he was teaching. The
same day I met him, he informed everyone that the class is going to be asynchronous with pre recorded to watch and the in person
lectures were more of Office hours. I thought that this was inconsiderate to the students because we signed up for this class
thinking it would be in person and now were being surprised with an online class after the add/drop period. Me personally, I learn
significantly better in person and it sucked for me because I thought the class was going to be in person. The professor is definitely
a good guy but definitely take into consideration the students he is affecting by doing something like that. He should instead register
the class as an online class. I dont think he necessarily encouraged my intellectual growth and progress because I did not get one
on one interaction with him and it was my own discipline and self teaching that got me there."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"yes,i practice a lot"
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"the class was very ""at your own pace"" style which was helpful and appreciated"
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,I have been forced to learn concepts I would not have otherwise
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I didn’t like that the class went remote, it made it a lot harder and worse"
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"The amount of example videos, practice problems, and references we were given were extremely helpful."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I learned from Professor Ely that it is best to start beforehand. This was something that benefited me in every Homework
assignment."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"I have not had a class where I was told to come to class as ""office hours"". Pathetic set up. If students are suppose to be coming to
class to learn during set times during the week, why does it 1) take two weeks for the professor to communicate that to us January–
February... 2) treat class time as a class to be seeking questions rather than having work taught to us, I could go on and on. Not a
great experience for this course. The professor is a very nice person and teaches the work (if we ask him) efficiently. Overall, this
course needs to be reevaluated significantly as many students have not learned much information due to the set up of the course."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,"It was nice to have so much online material/lectures/excel sheets on hand. That way, I could learn and review at my own pace. Also,
the professor was kind enough to explain every step — even if it seemed obvious/simple — just in case anyone couldn’t
understand."

learn elsewhere."
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,He is 1000 percent a good professor.
S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,growth,Videos were always straightforward and helpful. He always gave excess materials in case we were interested in doing extra

S2022-largeclass,2022,Spring,other,"I believe that this course was taught perfectly until very recently. This course was in fact taught completely asynchronously. The
materials and contents were all taught through pre–recorded videos that were uploaded by the professor. It is wrong to assume that
if a student were to go to the in–person ""recitations"" they would learn the course and the contents. The lectures were completely
asynchronous and this cannot be argued. It is wrong for the professor to say otherwise and inform students that the final exam will
be in–person on such short notice. This is extremely confusing for all students as they learned the course in an ""online"" format,
using EXCEL and other sources. Now that the final is in person, there is much confusion on if the material will be similar or not. For
a professor who I previously thought was very clear and communicative (teaching very effectively), this is shocking for me to so him
do."

F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,I liked that class was very straightforward_ I knew how each homework will be graded and that the Professor posted an announcement on exactly will be expected of us to know prior to the homework. The questions on the assignments are also based off what exactly we learned and there are no surprises.
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,"The course load was very manageable, and the instruction was very helpful"
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,I liked the independent async nature where I could watch the videos on my own time and come to recitation with any questions
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,opportunity to learn useful applications of excel and understand the relevant types of problems
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,The best structure of asynchronous class I have had at Rutgers.
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,I liked that the course applied a lot about Excel and that the concepts built on each other during the year.
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,The material is generally pretty interesting and understandable. It's also proved to be relevant to my other classes! I always enjoy that.
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,best,"The flexibility of it – it did not constrict my ability to do the work for my other classes in anyway, specifically because of the time given to get assignments done."

F2021-H1,2021,Fall,change,"The organization of the modules would be the main thing that I would do different. Instead of labeling the lectures as part 1,2, 3, etc, I would do it by topic so it is easier to know which one I need to go back to if I need to reference anything while studying.

When I didn't understand the material, I did not know where to go/who to ask for help. The lecture videos were split into like 10 parts or something per module – that made it really hard to follow the content because I didn't know how many lectures to watch/when.

I was quite overwhelmed by the long list of content for each lecture, and was often confused which week corresponded with which lectures, especially since our HW schedule was different than the original syllabus. I would make it more clear and more consistent which parts are lectures, which parts are complementary, which is the powerpoint etc. Maybe organizing each module into submodules would be less overwhelming. And explicitly detailing the week of each lecture. Also, I was in a section where you were our TA – I think that having access to other TA material and practice problems would be great, but I see that you have recently posted a complementary resource tab for the TA content. Doing this earlier on next semester would be helpful to all students."

F2021-H1,2021,Fall,other,"I felt incredibly unsupported by Professor Ely and the instructional team. In most of my courses this semester, I felt that I was genuinely learning a lot, even if I found the class really difficult or found the material not that interesting. With this course, I know I had the potential to learn a lot, but because of its organization I ended up being confused and cramming and not really learning anything beyond what I needed for the HWs. I think this class would best function as an online course that had 1 hour 20 min meetings twice a week."
F2021-H1,2021,Fall,other,"I think the final should be optional if we have done well on all of the homework up until now.

F2021-90,2021,Fall,growth,"He encouraged our intellectual growth and progress by having recitation available for all students. He lectured and went over both
computational examples by hand and using excel. Lastly, he talked about operations management topics in the real world with real
life settings, while also giving us optional websites outside references/sources to look into for in depth explanations if we are
interested in ops."
F2021-90,2021,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely is very clear about the material and provides a lot of additional material in the weekly lessons. I learned new things in

F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,excel knowledge
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,"The course workload is not bad, just study and prepare for HW’s and you will be good."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,I learned valuable tools that I can use later in life
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,I enjoyed that we had a recitation along with the class so that we were able to ask questions to the TA.

F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,–
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,"I liked how the HW’s perfectly bridged to one another. This allowed for a solid foundation to be built in the beginning of the semester, with more material being added on throughout the rest of the semester."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,the homeworks
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,I like the real life applications of the content that we learned.

F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,The HW
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,I like the videos that would allow students to rewatch them at their own convenience
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,We get a period of time to complete the quizzes instead of a set time.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,The TAs and recitations were very helpful
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,Practical application with clear support from quantitative problem solving.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,I liked it being asynchronous.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,the way that the class was taught
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,Everything was manageable and all the topics presented were described to their fullest extent.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,"In the lecture, Prof. Romulo Ely explains everything in a very organized and structured manner. This made the material easier to understand and follow."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,best,self–study mode
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,give a practice Homework
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Professor Romulo does a wonderful job of teaching this course. I would not do anything different.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would add additional practice problems to each lecture
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would give more supplement home work lie assignments there was supplement information but never things that would help students check for understanding. also maybe having a transcript if i were to do all videos like professor did because he was a bit hard to understand at some points
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing that i know of in particular!
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"If I were teaching this course, I would include review sessions with the professor as opposed to just having review sessions in recitations."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,have the modules on canvas be more organized with dates of the recommending time to finish each lecture.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Have an in person lecture but that is just because of COVID
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Put videos in one not split and into modules that are more concise
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Some of the questions on the homework were very difficult to understand.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"The lectures themselves were easy for me to understand and I felt comfortable with all the material after watching the videos and attending recitations, but I felt some of the homework questions were tricky, and having the ""none of the above"" option would often confuse me as well."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"The homework questions when true/false were often structured as passive sentences, so I felt like I had a difficult time understanding them. When it was asking whether a definition was true/false, the definition was first then the term at the end, which made the sentence awkward and confusing to understand and read."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"We could not ask questions during the homework, and I felt like that negatively affected my performance."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I felt like the homework questions were more difficult than the lectures.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I could understand the lectures well and went to all the recitations, but some questions on the homework were confusing, and since I could not ask questions it negatively impacted my grades."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would like to be able to backtrack on the homework.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I think that the way materials were uploaded was a little overwhelming. Sometimes I would get 20 emails from Canvas when the next section was uploaded. And I was not sure if lectures would be coming out the next week or two weeks from now based on the material given. It is a bit challenging distinguishing between what is an Excel solution, complimentary material, and what lecture video discusses what topic."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would make the lecture sizes smaller and divide them up by ""class"" period"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Maybe give some extra credit or drop the lowest homework grade that way students can have a second chance to still do well if they mess up one assignment.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,This course was a mess. The canvas site was so disorganized. I had no motivation to actually do the work
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"TAs can be more accessible outside of class. As I know that recitations are their ""office hours"" it would be better if they were accessible outside of their office hours to go out problems."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,homework problems
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing really
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would have synchronous lectures not just recitations.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,give more time for the assignments
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I just wish I could have taken it in person
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would maybe try and engage the class more
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Offer more assignments
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would teach it very differently. It is too messy now. I would make the lectures longer so that there aren’t so many videos to go through. Psychologically it gets tiring. I would also make us do hands on exercises which I feel are the best way to learn.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Nothing, the way it was designed was excellent!"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,More interaction with the students would have been welcome
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would offer more quizzes that would account for a small portion of our final grade. So we can stay focused on the material at an even more regular basis
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing!
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Nothing really, canvas more organized."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,more engaging less lectures
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,organize canvas better
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I think the option to drop the lowest HW grade will really be helpful
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Include less information in each less lecture because it was a lot
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Spread out the homework assignments more if possible.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Hold the recitations online as well, as this may have promoted more participation from students who were unable to make it in person."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Have more practice questions similar to those on the HWs. personally, I feel like there is a stark difference between the practice question in the modules and the HW questions."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,give less lectures to watch
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,organize canvas better
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would have made the modules more organized. I think having all those supplemental materials within the modules made it confusing to look at and find the actual lectures. I would also provide problems in the lecture that resembled some exam questions because while the exams were not terrible to figure out there were some questions that made me wonder whether we had even learned a concept like that.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would not do anything differently.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,separate the modules by week
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would have in person sections.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,i would make more assignments as these assignments have few questions and each one takes a large toll on the grade
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"easier homework assignments, shorter lectures, more relevant lectures."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Nothing, the professor made the class very enjoyable and easy to understand"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,less material posted. lecture videos were posted in 10 separate 10 minute long videos I would’ve liked just 1 longer video
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,n/a
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Organize canvas a bit better. It becomes very confusing w the amount of links we were given
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Post some more current lectures.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I thought our professor did a great job teaching this course.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would give out study guides and hw to prepare better for exam.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would try to put the lectures into one video instead of multiple per week.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"If I were teaching this class differently, I think I would try to assign more excel-based assignments so students have more opportunities to learn and develop a better understanding of excel."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would allow backtracking during the homework and have the lectures live
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would add quiz questions in the video lectures so that we get used to the type of question that will be in the homework and have a chapter ending quiz for each chapter
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Organize Canvas better
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would provide a more flexible grading system with more possible grades to earn or a different structure of homeworks.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I prefer synchronous classes so I would have set a time for the class to meet on zoom.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Try to condense the lesson a bit.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would be a little more concise with the material, especially in the video lectures."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I think it is perfect the way it is!
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Lectures are quite long and there is a lot of material to sort through on the Canvas page. I think it should be split into modules to make it easier to manage so that students can minimize tabs they are not using. Also, maybe one page of complementary material that can be minimized as it is quite challenging to discern between the Excel sheets, presentations, complementary material, and videos."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,More interaction with students from professor
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"If possible, I would try to condense the lectures (make the class less time consuming)."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,related topics to real life scenarios
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would host review sessions for quizzes.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,too much “fluff” content. needs to be condensed and to the point.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,give more assignments to reduce weight of each grade
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing – he was very detailed and explained everything he was doing and why
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would put more incentives to watch all of the videos.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would not make none of the above so prevalent on exams has it just led to confusion and a decrease in personal grades.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Remove ""none of the above"" answer choices from the tests."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Give practice problems as homework
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Give more homework for practice
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Assign the videos with larger time segments, everything was too split up."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would organize the videos and practice questions better by creating To–Do lists/Checklists and study guides before the HWs.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would not make 100,000 lecture videos for each week. More simplicity and efficiency. Also, get rid of the ""none of the above"" option on the assignments. You grew too fond of it. It had a net negative effect on my learning."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I think the course was fair. I just wish there were more opportunities to boost your grade, like having mini assignments."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would make the homework assignments longer because each question was worth too many points. Therefore, if I got only 2 questions wrong my grade was no longer an A. On multiple occasions, I felt that the grade I received on the homework did not accurately reflect how well I knew the material."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Make the online lectures shorter and more organized.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would turn on my camera so students feel more engaged in the learning material because posting lectures with just audio makes me feel really disconnected. I would also post all the lectures in one run instead of multiple videos and make the Canvas more organized.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would reduce the number of quizzes
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would be more active in answering student questions and teach live.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would give students extra problems or provide a review that would be similar to exams so that way students can prepare and not walk in to an assessment with any surprises.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Potentially incorporate a project in replacement of the one of the four exams.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Make it more clear and actually teach, all the assignments are computer graded and you can tell the lectures have been reused"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would be more lenient when it comes to due dates. I had a personal issue, and the professor would not extend the date of one of my homework assignments, despite the assignment being auto-graded. I had another professor that allowed me to pick a day to reschedule an exam. Her attitude and her willingness to work with me showed me how much she cares about her students. I did not get that feeling from Professor Romulo at all."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I wish the lecture videos were uploaded directly onto Canvas because it can generate subtitles; Box doesn’t seem to do that and subtitles help me process the information better.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Nothing, the class was set up really well."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would make exams less hard.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,The exam questions should be more similar to what was covered in class
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would make the walkthrough videos shorter, each problem video is way too long."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"organize canvas more. there were a lot of files just thrown up under the module, which is overwhelming for students. I’d rather have extra problems/examples put in files and save module for actual lecture videos and notes."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,n/a Professor Ely did an amazing job
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,None of the above questions in the HWs were very confusing sometimes… and the options would be very specific
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,More questions on the quizzes
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Maybe make some of the videos more concise
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Record the recitations and make them available to the class whenever needed.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would probably monitor the people who participate and give them credit
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Not much, he really went above and beyond to help out with resources and work."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I wish the lectures were placed in a file and not through the modules tab, it made it difficult to easily access the lectures."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would include more practice problems from the textbook.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"The modules on Canvas need to be more organized. Certain sections did not have all the videos in one place. Also, there were multiple errors in the video lectures that I had to constantly keep track of which made the topic more challenging than it needed to be."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I think for Canvas, it would have been easier to separate each lecture into different modules, rather than making it all one module."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,there are too many modules so It is hard to find specific things.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would maybe offer more opportunities for points
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Teach more effectively
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Something I would do differently is create challenging questions for the students who have mastered concepts.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I don’t think it’s necessary to have a recitation.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,The material was very unorganized and at times hard to follow. All the materials for the weeks assignments were very hard to follow. There was no sense of direction and the material (including unnecessary material) were all posted in one list.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Label the videos or put into one big video
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,i would post study guides as well
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I feel like giving students more access to practice problems and reviews will allow for better comprehension of material
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,f
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Study guide or more practice problems
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,None
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I wouldn’t change a thing.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"The only way to encourage learning is to have classes in person. Or, at least synchronous online."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing honestly
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,More communication with Professor and less heavily graded assignments
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Make the lectures more manageable
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Give more assignments
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would reorganize the modules and re-title the files. It isn’t always clear what files contain based on their current titles.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Make the modules page look less overwhelming.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would not be able to tell you, as I imagine structuring a class is actually very difficult."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Add more detail to the slides, when taking notes it is difficult to discern what is important and what is irrelevant to the course from the slides alone."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would have a mandatory meeting for the fully remote students at least once a month, to check on student progress."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"My biggest gripe with this class is the Canvas organization/ There was only one module for all of the content; had this been broken down into one module per chapter, that would have been very helpful."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"Not much, maybe be a little more interactive with students."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would structure the canvas site so that each lecture had a module and outline more what videos needed to be watched at what times.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Make the homework more similar to the lectures
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would add more information on the slides that relate to the homework.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Less homework
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Organize the lectures so they are listed in one folder but overall enjoyed the class.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would label the videos better and try to consolidate them. It was confusing to review lectures later on.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would prepare a script for the videos and or use a different method. Watching 5+ videos for just one lecture is overwhelming.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would not post so many videos as he does. They are split up very oddly and I have to keep opening tabs for them, and it is just very annoying."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,a
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"canvas setup was confusing, a lot of links in modules"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,More HW assignments
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would do nothing differently as it was done well
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,N/a
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,nothing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would organize the material files better. For example, I will put all the additional materials into a pdf file (because these are all links). Putting too many files sometimes makes me feel overwhelmed and lost."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Break assignments up so as to halve intensity but double frequency. This would allow better solidification of topics that lie between the larger sections of the course.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,I would separate the lectures in modules to make them more organized.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,Nothing at all. Professor Ely was very effective in teaching the material.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"It is unfortunate because of Covid–19, but I would have liked to see the professor live rather than as recorded lectures."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"I would organize the Canvas site better so that everything was in separate modules instead of just one. Also, I would separate the required material from the complementary material."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,do the same thing
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,change,"In Canvas, in Modules, there was a great deal of material that was additional and this made each section very disorganized and there was too much material to sort through. It was be better is the lecture and primary material was prioritized first in the list and all the other additional material was sorted out more."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,making us think of the problems ourselves and encouraging us to try them without his help first
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Romulo gave us all the course materials that we need in order to understand the difficult concepts.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,By providing the basics of operations management that can be applied to more complex situations
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Ely truly cares for his students. He responds fast to our questions.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,This course has caused me to overanalyze everything and honestly made my test taking anxiety even worse because of the interestingly worded questions and the high amount of points per question.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Absolutely, the professor is very thorough with his lectures and explains all the material in an effective manner. I learned a lot from him this semester"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Always nice and positive, very organized class."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The material was challenging but taught in an efficient way which has given me a lot of knowledge.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,I really like how there were plenty of examples given that explained not only how to arrive at the answer but why that was the answer. Seeing all the graphs and how changing certain variables manipulated the final equation and what that meant in the real world was extremely fascinating.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Ely explained things with a lot of detail and I thoroughly enjoyed taking his class.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"It has definitely showed me that my test taking skills need to improve. Whenever approached by a problem on the HWs, I find myself panicked even though I went over the lecture videos and felt prepared. As such, it led to my poor performance on the first quizzes."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,More practice
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Made me motivated to work
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He allowed me to think outside the box
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,it has shown me how to think critically in ways I haven’t learned before.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He has made my critical thinking a lot stronger
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He has allowed me to learn effectively virtually
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely made it very easy to communicate with him, whether it was a question regarding an assignment, providing a clear grading criteria, or just making sure all students are prepared and understand what is expected of them to do well"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"I have no comments about the content, but I am disappointed about the way it was presented. I retained absolutely no information and it was a struggle trying to keep up with this class. Instead of throwing a million lectures at us and making us memorize formulas, the class could have been organized better."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Yes, Romulo Neves Ely has encouraged my intellectual growth and progress because the way he teaches the class it was easier to understand and able to solve the problem."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"He was genuinely interested in the topics and loved to teach them as evident within the lecture videos posted to the Canvas site, which made the class all the more interesting to learn."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Prof Ely was always responsive to questions
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Very willing to help at all times
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He was cool.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He always uploads a lot of extra material and practice questions
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Interesting topics.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,All of his lecture videos were fun to watch and easy to understand! He is a positive professor who seems to be very passionate about the subject.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,I was able to learn the techniques required to solve application-based problems that are relevant to the business industry.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Ely made the subject easier to understand. He’s very thorough in explaining problems in lectures.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Encouraged students to learn excel
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He was thorough with his lectures and gave us a lot of supplemental material.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He taught the content in an exciting way.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Ely thoroughly explained difficult topics in an interesting manner
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"challenged me to learn new excel methods, new ways to approach problems, and broaden my mindset."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Our instructor has provided sufficient resources for us to learn the topics of the course as well as complementary resources such as articles and videos for us to better understand the material from different perspectives.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He created an open discussion post we could ask questions in at any time & he responded in less than a few hours to each post. during exam times he answered the questions in minutes
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,I finally understood how to do minimization and maximization problems. My math teacher tried to explain it years ago and I could never understand it until I took this class.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The excel work can be used in my everyday life.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely gave a lot of real life examples, we only have 4 HW in total, no quizzes. By watching his lecture videos I learned a lot on how to use excel."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"I’ve begun to think in a more analytical way, regarding my problem solving skills."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Nothing really since the course was online
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Romulo Neves Ely took the time and dedication to go through abstract ideas that were hard to grasp and explain them in a way that allowed students to understand.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,presented all the content very eagerly and clearly
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"The class was asynchronous so I do not have much feedback. However, I feel it was delivered fairly and efficiently."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,This course gave me a better understanding of important excel functions and a better grasp of breaking down intricate problems and coming up with solutions to solve them.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely always ran through many examples during lecture, and this has helped me understand the material a lot better. There were no surprises during the homeworks, and the homework only tested my understanding of the concepts which was really great."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Real-world examples, showing how to use Excel effectively"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Additional complementary material
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He encouraged me to develop my Excel skills and how to model and solved problems.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He made sure we knew the topics well.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"With the assignments that he assigns, and through the lectures we learn a great deal"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Helped present material in a clear organized way to maximize learning
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,By giving many examples of problems to practice before homeworks.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,It offered me a new perspective by learning coursework I had never previously been exposed to.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,No growth or progress occurred. I think you overtaught. You overcomplicated things. There was an overload of material and lecture videos and a lot of them seemed unnecessary. Be more efficient.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He was prepared and had a great understanding of the material.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Romulo Ely is very understanding and posted lots of resources students can use to enhance their knowledge.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,easy to follow lectures
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,N/A
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,no! everything is perfect
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He helped my confidence with excel.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The content of the course was quite difficult.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Be more clear, and not tell me when I send an email question to your RU email, that I need to send it to a gmail."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"He introduced me to a new part of excel I had no idea about, the solver. He also helped me be able to organize information from a model and model it effectively."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,I really liked the fact that he gave us a large window of time to complete the exams and that they were open note so we could go at our own pace and it encouraged actual learning instead of rote memorization. The asynchronous format of the lectures was great to that end as well.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Very easy to understand
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,His Lectures being very thorough and his TA’s always being dedicated to helping their students.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The videos were organized well
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He constantly teaches us important steps that former students used to get caught in
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"He helped me learn through pre recorded videos better, and help develop explanation skills"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,great
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"I learned about integer programming, non-linear programming, and linear programming."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Material was interesting so I enjoyed in the course
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Slightly more engaging lectures would have been nice, but it was prerecorded, so I don’t really blame him."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"not really, really hard to understand his class"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The professor made lectures easy to follow and encouraged questions.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He gave you all the resources you needed to succeed so it was easy to want to learn the material.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Ely seemed to desire to answer any questions in a prompt manner.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,it encouraged independent learning which was nice because i liked going at my own pace
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He is always open to questions and provides resources to enhance the learning experience
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,f
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,None
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,He taught the class well and encouraged the students to do all the homework. Doing the homework helped me understand the material better.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Made sure students understood as much as possible by explaining the same topic in different ways (e.g. drawings, excel, etc.)."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,motivated
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Considering the course was asynchronous and I never met the Professor, I cannot say this class encouraged learning at all. It rather encouraged doing the bare minimum to get by."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,he has helped me think differently about things
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,The course information was split up properly
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Extra pressure of only having a handful of graded assignments made me study extra hard
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,I really liked that Professor Romulo Neves Ely added “complimentary material” to his modules to give us real life examples of what we were learning and how it applies to actual jobs. It added substance to what we were learning and showed I will actually use these skills potentially in the future
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"Nice voice, friendly sounding. Explained things in sufficient detail always."
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Using real life examples.
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,"N/A, course was asynchronous and the professor was only there to guide us through the course material"
F2021-largeclass,2021,Fall,growth,Professor Romulo is a very organized and thorough teacher. He explained all course materials with numerous examples and verbal explanations. His teaching methods encouraged my growth and progress in the course.

F2021-5B,2021,Fall,growth,HE has created a genuine interest in this subject and that was reflected onto the students
F2021-5B,2021,Fall,growth,His lectures were very clear and he went above and beyond to make sure students understand all facets of the question.

their names are similar."

F2021-5A,2021,Fall,change,"The course was somewhat disorganized with wildly different experiences for students based on whether they were in a professor taught section as I was or a TA one. Those of us in a professor one had 'office hours' instead of class and had to watch lengthy, disorganized, incomplete, sometimes misleading and sometimes downright rambling lectures that took 5–9 hours to explain a 35 minute topic while not even fully covering the topic in question. The 'homework' exams then had many questions with poor wording, mistakes, misleading information etc. which is even more difficult with an instructor who refuses to even engage the possibility that a question could be any of the above nor would explain to a student how to improve or understand said material better."

F2021-5A,2021,Fall,change,I would maybe assign a few more assignments to ensure that students were understanding specific topics.
F2021-5A,2021,Fall,change,"Meant to trick students on homework, so even if you understand the question and can explain, will probably get it wrong because it’s
multiple choice"
F2021-5A,2021,Fall,change,"I would have had live lectures and a more organized structure to the course. There was no set timeline for assignments and the
Canvas site was very overwhelming. I would have better paced the course as all of our assignments were in the second half of the
semester, leaving me to feel very rushed and stressed."
F2021-5A,2021,Fall,growth,"Gave me critical concepts to think about and understand as I enter my career. Some of the concepts were complex but very

S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I thought that it was fun to solve these problems and come back every week to lectures because the professor felt excited to teach.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"The lecture and recitation videos were extremely informative and I liked that I could always refer back to them. I think this structure
was effective for the course, instead of a live lecture."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I loved how the professor and TA's have been so helpful.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked the use of Excel.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"I enjoyed that there was a lot of mathematics and quantitative–based thinking. It definitely prepares students for BAIT–type thinking
like optimizing and efficiency in a business."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The asynchronous format allowed me to complete the work on my own time without feeling rushed.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I think the teaching style of the professor.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked the fact that I did not have to worry about time constraints while taking exams.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,recitations enabled me to understand the material way better than the lectures did
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,How helpful the TAs are
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The Ta's
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"Having gone into this class without any prior knowledge, I did find some of the topics to be rather interesting."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,What I like about this course the TA is beneficial and scheduled to learn for this class is very flexible
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The ability to watch the lecture on your time
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The content is pretty easy to comprehend.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The online manner of it
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Professor Rumulo is really kind and helpful.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The course materials are posted online and we can view them anytime if we want
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Starts off simple and over the course of the sem the ideas build but its never too much or unfair
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"recitations were easy to follow, lots of extra material and practice if needed available"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"What I liked best was the lack of an attendance policy. Sitting in either online or in–person lectures for this course would have been
a waste of time."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked learning more about the different functions in excel and how they relate to real life.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,It was good
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The clear lectures
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Excel learning
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I enjoyed the real life applications of the subject matters.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked the pacing of material and topics
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Asynchronous and assignments split up well
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,– The lectures and assignments were very interesting!
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The material that has been covered.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Becoming more adaptable towards numbers and the utilization of product efficiency with data models.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"I liked the long extensive problems the most, it is very satisfying after fully understanding the material"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,It wasn't a overwhelming workload and learned a lot about business operations and management through OR.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The explaination of the problems weren't that bad.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The homeworks are fair and we are given a lot of time to do them.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,TA recitations
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,– Not a super heavy course but exciting material
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"I liked how the lectures were organized, and the format of the Homeworks."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I love how professor gives really good examples in his powerpoints
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The professor was very fair and the materials were organized.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The quizzes
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I find the material pretty easy to manage with practice
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,None
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,How it is organized.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,There are many examples
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Good and useful content caught clearly
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Using Excel and learning new tricks and tips.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"The TAs all did an excellent job. I did not utilize their recitations and walk–ins until the second exam and they were extremely
valuable for the rest of the course."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,The in depth content
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,detailed explanations . responsive professor. great TAs
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked how Professor Eli always used word problems and real–world examples to explain class concepts.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I found that the TA's helped out a lot
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,content
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,We learned key formulas/processes that are ran in a day to day business place.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I was able to learn a lot from the lecture and recitation videos. They were easy to understand and very helpful.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,"I enjoyed the detail in the lectures,"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,I liked that we had recitations that allowed us to learn the material in a more concise matter. Also it was pretty organized
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Easy to navigated even though it was asynchronous.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,learning excel feels practical
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,that every homework has 7 hours to do.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,Nothing.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,no homework
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,best,the video lecture and ppt
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"The canvas modules seemed disorganized with many lectures split into several parts rather than 2–3 max. Had to sift through 16
parts for just one lecture which was inconvenient."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I felt that Professor Ely did a great job teaching this course and there isn't any specific thing I would change as the instructor of this
course."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I did not enjoy how the professor organized his lectures. His lectures were pre–recorded and split into 10–30 minute clips which
could accumulate to 15–19 parts. I would have preferred the lecture to be recorded all in once to eliminate opportunities for
distractions."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,None
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"nothing, it was great"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would demonstrate more examples and this course deserves to be on–campus/in–person and not online.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would make the exams a bit easier I did think they were a little harder or encourage students to come after class for help.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,more face to face interaction
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More live lectures
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would have a little more theoretical explanation/ discussion because a lot of homework concepts were hard to answer because of
lack of theory in lectures."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Allow students to backtrack on questions
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Enforce deadlines better
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"N/A, it was well taught for an online course"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Although I'd rather have more resources than fewer to study from, sometimes it felt a bit overwhelming and I'd like if the material on
the exam was a bit more emphasized in those resources rather than being a bit broad."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More small assignments
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More assignments for credit. Class heavily reliant on 4 assignments and final.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Provide more of an aspect of what was going to be on the homeworks/exams
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Having a specific time for lectures would help structure the course more.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,n/a
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,The professor and the course are good
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"nothing, it was great."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would make the homework easier or provide practice problems that are reflective of the homework.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would present the material in an organized way that clearly outlines what is being asked of by the student. It was very difficult due to
the disorganization to figure out what was the required work and lectures to watch."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would try to consolidate the material a bit more
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Have homework assignments so the concepts learned could be learned more effectively than just watching videos and following
excel files."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Live lecture
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,have live lectures as the registration suggested
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Nothing really. Asynchronous worked pretty well, especially with the video lectures."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing I think it was perfectly taught.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would have organized the material a bit better. There was so much being posted that I was very overwhelmed looking at it all. Most
of it was additional resources but I knew I didn't have time to view every single thing so I constantly felt like there was more work to
be done. I was hard to gage what material was actually necessary and what was not."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I liked the enthuses on problems but I felt some of the lectures were a little long to sit through discussing just one problem. A
similar length summary of the entire module followed by slightly shorter work throughs of various problems would have been easier
to absorb. While the explanations were detailed and well put together, this class being asynchronous with videos only would get a
little at times."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would maybe have some live lectures. There are simply too many videos. Watching the videos does not help.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,As previously mentioned
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would actually teach and not rely on the TA to do that
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,The same
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would probably hold the lectures ""in–person,"" not prerecorded."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would not think of a better way!
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I think the course is run well, and the format should not be changed."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Yes
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Utilize recitation more
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would improve the quality of audio / video by recording in a higher resolution. Also would not use dropbox since occasionally it
would stop working."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Better platforms of communication
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Perhaps condense the lectures a bit more, like he did in office hours."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would have held more live sessions, whether or not they are mandatory, to optimize student engagement and convenience."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Worded some HW questions better
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would most likely make the assessments a little more clear and easier for the class
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More variability in the ability to improve grades in the class.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,The only thing I would do differently is offer some more smaller assignments as additional practice.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"The course was very disorganized in that the professor split up lectures in multiple parts (anywhere between 2–8 parts). However,
these parts were not labeled, making it difficult to navigate. The wording on exams were also very confusing. To improve the course,
I would make it more organized and clear as to what questions are asking."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Make more fixed class that can let students exchange ideas.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,make it more engaging
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,teach the class on zoom
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More interaction
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Made it zoom instruction and require participation.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,None Professor was awesome
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would hold live classes
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Everything is good. I may provide a solution sheet with explanations for each homework on Canvas.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Revise wording of some homework questions as some are often tricky or challenging to identify what the question is asking for.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"The only change I would really make is the layout of the Canvas page. If the lectures had been uploaded at individual modules, it
would be easier to find the material. Since it was all under one module, it was difficult to differentiate certain material at times.
Although, it was in order, so it was not too bad."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Each weekly module had hours and hours (and more hours!) of pre recorded videos. It was too much and I didn't have time to watch
everything unfortunately. The pre recorded TA sessions helped, but it was even more hours there too."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,i would try and keep a more regular schedule for all of that HW assignments.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Organize it better
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Give more homework assignments
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,n/a
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I think hosting live sessions would have been beneficial
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,i would focus more on how to use excel to get values as opposed to manually doing it
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would utilize modules when posting lectures. Instead of listing everything under one module and creating lots of scrolling to get to
the final lecture, I would split it up. One module for each lecture with all materials needed would keep the class organized and make it easier to find things. I would also make it to where you didn't have to download everything to open files. Allowing the preview
window in Canvas to show the document would be helpful over sorting through 10's of documents for each lecture."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would strongly change the way the exams are formatted. The none of the above answers are very tricky.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I am not sure.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Just get straight to the point, the professor can make the easiest thing difficult by explaining it more and more and confusing it when
it is just a simple thing, and keep the lectures short as possible to keep the interest of the students till the end of the lecture"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I wouldn't change anything.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,make the lectures more condensed and not base everything off excel
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would make the final worth less and teach more similar problems to the homework.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Not use Discord for TA interaction
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Cater to separate student's needs
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"If I were teaching the course, I would provide fewer homework assignments. The homework feels similar to taking an exam. As a
result, I feel like I have been taking an exam every two or three weeks, which was stressful. Instead of 4 homework assignments
and a final exam, I feel like I am taking 5 exams."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"The professors biggest problem is when he does exams, he words the problems so poorly. I do fine, but I have heard students
complaining a lot. Let me put it this way, in all three of our tests, everyone has gotten points back because he messed something
up."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Give more assignments to help put more grades in
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would organize the online Canvas site in a much clearer manner. There were way too many supplemental materials that were
clouding the main material and made me confused as to what would be tested on and what we were required to know to do well in
the course.
Please offer live recitations in addition to the asynchronous lectures. Since everything is asynchronous it is very hard to get live help
when you need it."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Give fewer questions during homework.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Made the questions for assignments less tricky
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Give a sample exam, at least, so student can get a feeling of what the exam may be like, the HW are hard with notes i dont know
how the exam is going to be"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would have had set meeting times for lectures, there was too much material posted on canvas that created some disorganization.
I enjoyed the complementary material but would have liked Webex or Zoom lectures instead of watching prerecorded videos"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,more concise lectures.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Make the lectures less time.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would make sure the wording of the exam questions is more clear and sometimes include a more thorough description of the
answer choices in parenthesis."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I believe a system with a midterm and final exam with some homework assignments which were not in the exam format as they are
now would work better. While I did well on the online test homeworks, many students felt stressed by this system since we were
essentially studying for an exam every other week towards the end of the semester."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Label the hw as quizzes and have smaller hw assignments so your grade isn't solely dependent on essentially, tests."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Examples are outdated, not relevant, Quizzes need to be redesigned as they are terribly worded and ambiguous in nature. Answers
in the quizzes should be correct and there should be no need to regrade as it just confuses students."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would put less content on the Canvas page so it does not look so overwhelming.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Synchronus
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would explain more clearly because the students are left with a lot of questions
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing. Professor Ely went about teaching the course content perfectly.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Some extra practice problems with recorded explanations for some chapters would not hurt before homework quizzes.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would reorganize the Canvas a bit differently. Currently, all the lectures and material are in one drop–down in Canvas. I would
recommend creating separate drop–downs for each lecture because it would really help with navigating Canvas!"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would have made it more interactive.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would not make lecture videos that are so long. We had to watch 10–12 40 minute videos every week just to keep up with the
content so it took up a lot of time. Additionally, there was no way to practice the material so we made sure that we understood it enough to prepare it for the exams."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would have more practice assignments that are lightly graded (lightly weighted overall) so that we can practice the problems and
get a response on how we do them."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I think this only applies to the online semester, but it was really confusing and difficult to keep up with everything/going on discord to
watch hourly lectures/going on canvas to watch hourly lectures. For the homework, I wish solutions would be posted after so we can
check and learn why we got something wrong. I understand we are meant to take the step of asking a professor/TA, but why are the
resources necessary to learn from our mistakes not something easily accessible to students?"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Honestly, I truly enjoyed this course and it was amazing. I would not do anything differently"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would organize the modules with different title names making them easier to find.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,provide study guides
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Maybe make the class mandatory to attend
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I do think the videos were done well however with multiple separate videos I do think it was a bit difficult to follow along sometimes.
Maybe in the future just uploading an entire video with timestamps?"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,N/A
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing to change.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Assign more assignments
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,No recitation thru discord
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would not do anything differently.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Possibly more example questions for the Homework to practice off of.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Only having 5 grades total
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Obviously be taught in person but going of off it being online, have synchronous meetings with the class and make attendance
mandatory. Personally I find it hard to keep up sometimes with asynchronous classes and this class in particular can get confusing
at times."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,arrange the website more clearly
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I think everything was ran greatly, I wouldn’t change anything"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I might organize the Canvas page a little bit better like making each lecture a different section so I can collapse it when I am done
going over it."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Organize the chapters into their own modules, give clear reminders, word HW and exam questions with proper English grammar,
and put all lectures in the media gallery."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would make the lectures more straight forward instead of dragging on for a long time going into detail for the things that we don't
need to know for exams."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would try to word the exam clearer
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Maybe I would give smaller HWs but for each chapter.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,more interacive
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would post more videos.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would make the assignments longer because getting 1 or 2 wrong is the difference of a letter grade.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Not much I’d change. Pretty good course overall
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,None
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Make it synchronous, it is hard to go through and understand everything without it being live."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing much.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Make lectures shorter
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would give each lecture their own module in Canvas. Its pretty hard trying to find the lectures through canvas. Also I would have
someone look over my questions for the homework."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Have more practice problems.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Assign more work so the exams are not the full grade from the course.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would hold the class synchronous
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Reduce the length of video lectures, at times there were so many and they were all relatively long."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would shorten the lecture lengths because each lecture had SEVERAL parts and especially with the class being fully
asynchronous it was very hard to get motivated"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I have no comments this was a great course.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,– I would possibly spread the homeworks out better so the last 3 arent back to back to back.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"Lectures were a bit meandering and overwhelming. The bizarre lectures are more so because of the curriculum than the professor.
I would push students towards the TAs because they taught with more clarity."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"The course is taught so in depth that I don't have the attention span to watch through all of the videos because there are so many so
I just watch recitations because they're quicker . many people agree but it's nice that he's so passionate and knows what he's
talking about"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I felt that the lectures were very long. I often relied solely on the recitation videos and only referred to the lectures if I was confused
about something. I appreciate the effort that the prof put into breaking the videos up but I think it would've just been logistically easier
to have a 1–3 videos for each topic."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would not change anything
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would recommend like classes
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Definitely require attendance and a live lecture
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,More detailed lectures
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,make explanations more concise
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I would do an actual zoom meetings rather than just uploading them
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I think the Canvas site needs to be better organized to indicate which videos and links are part of the course and which ones are
supplementary. It was a bit overwhelming at first, so maybe the supplementary resources could go in a different section."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"My only complaint is the layout of Professor Eli's class Canvas page. Within each chapter, there are links to approximately 4–8
videos that must be watched to keep up with course material, but these videos are often hidden within 20–30 files, optional videos,
excel files, and other links that make it very difficult to find the required videos to watch. Perhaps the excel files could be linked along
with the video that it's associated with, saving some space and time for students."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,Nothing.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,"I would organize it better. There was a lot of complementary material but it wasn't organized well. There was too much to sort
through. Also, I wish the lecture videos weren't split up into over 5 parts."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,I will provide more teaching software that helps students solve the problem and knowledge easily and effectively
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,change,more assignments to boost grades
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I have gained a better understanding of using excel and models to find more effective solutions operations and management
problems."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,I loved how he broke up the material and made it easy to follow while watching at home. I was able to follow along pretty well.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"He showed concern when emailing him for information and provided us with office hours, discussion sections, and extensive time
for our work which was much appreciated and helped me properly learn the materials."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,This course and Prof. Romulo's teaching piqued my interest in Operations Research & Management.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,The instructor showed a lot of interest during the lectures which motivated me to learn.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Providing various example problems and solutions
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I felt very interested in the course material and his teaching and assessment methods were effective and promoted greater
conceptual understanding. I feel confident about the topics he taught"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,n/a
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Helped me be responsible
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"It required me to take more responsibility for what I was learning, while the professor assisted where he could, much of it was on
the student to keep up with classwork and lectures."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,None
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,n/a
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,this course is connected with reality. It is useful to learn how do we find the optimal solution under different situations.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He helped me learn operations management.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"The content such as lectures, recordings, and office hours helped me succeed in this class."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,this course was too disorganized to encourage my intellectual growth and progress
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,This course helped me become more interested in operations of a company. It was taught well.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,The material that we learned was interesting because it is used by businesses everyday. He seemed to enjoy the material.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,The lecture in clips method is not helpful
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"He presents the material slowly and effectually, making for a thorough and manageable learning environment. Many professors
gloss over concepts in favor of some exceptional students, but Professor Ely makes no exceptions and wants everyone to
understand the topics."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Although we were online he did a great job teaching the course and interacting with students. Romulo Neves Ely made sure we
understood everything from complex topics to simple homework instruction. So overall just his enthusiasm and willingness to tech
encouraged my growth and progress."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Already well–done
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"A lot of the course material was definitely stuff that made me interested in the idea of optimization. Also, it was the first class where I
properly learned how to use solver."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,he hasn't
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Very Good
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,N/A
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Yes
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Always did a good job with office hours
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He’s good
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,I really liked that the lectures were cut down into semi–short managable videos that explained things concept–by–concept.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"None, lectures were clear and office hours were very helpful"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Have at least a few synchronous sessions (not necessarily weekly) throughout the semester to engage students virtually.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Video lectures, extra problems"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"His explanations were always very thorough, and he would take his time in order to simplify concepts as much as possible."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He was a good teacher who made the course easy to follow.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Professor Romulo was really good at making sure us students had the resources necessary to succeed.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"The professor definitely goes in depth when discussing topics. He spends a lot of time going over each problem and exploring the
various scenarios that are associated with those particular problems."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Good course materials and easy to understand.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,sure
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,none
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,I like that he tries to get students to understand the material rather than just memorizing
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"He used real world examples to show us applications of the materiel
He is responsive to questions and sincerely willing to help you when you reach out
Lecture videos are self explanatory"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I think that professor Ely could improve his course by holding live lectures. I had a had time following his video lectures although
they were always available and clear besides his accent. I also appreciate that he was aware of his accent and did his best to
convey topics."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,The course helps me develop my problem solving skills.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Inspired me to learn more about operations research and its impact in solving business problems and how I can it apply it to
everyday life."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He is an enthusiastic man. I hate online school but he’s nice.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,It is going well.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,No comment
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,N/A
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Romulu was a good professor who kept the class organized really well and put in work for his students
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,using modules to separate the lectures instead of all in one module would make it more easier to find material
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,It has not done that whatsoever.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He has taught us a lot about methods and excel parts of operations management.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He went step by step and was extremely patient.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Good organization and clear directions
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Professor Ely has encouraged my intellectual growth by thoroughly explaining the content. He elaborated on how to solve problems
in different ways to help students better understand what was happening."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He encouraged my intellectual growth by having well–detailed visual slides that helped me learn.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I appreciated having a variety of sources to study from, including recitations."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He is very insightful on certain topics
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"The professor is down to earth and easy to talk to and encourages questions. He allows students to not feel intimidated to ask
questions and answers them in depth"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Taught me a lot about excel and how to be fast and proficient in it.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"He made the workload understandable and manageable. He offered office hours to answer any and all questions and clarified all
work in his announcements."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He taught the concepts in terms we could understand while also not giving us too many trick questions.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"He is very quick to respond to emails and student questions in the class discussion forum, which allows the students to learn
better."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,This class felt more like annoying busy work
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Very little, he seems very invested in the course, but I dont see that being portrayed to the students."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"had him for online, if it wasn't for the TA's this class would have been extremely difficult and for nog good reason. the material is not
intuitive, and the slides are not comprehensive enough to teach yourself"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"His enthusiasm and effectiveness to respond to student questions on the discussion board helped with learning a lot. His video
lectures were easy to navigate and understand and help generate further knowledge and practice into the material."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I really appreciated the consistent office hours and discussion board because it established a sense of connection, despite the
semester being remote."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He has pushed us to study hard and achieve different aspects of the course.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Professor Ely had a lot of videos that made sure that we understood all of the necessary information.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He was always ready to answer emails with questions which I truly appreciate. It most definitely helped in my learning.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"The homeworks were extremely helpful as practice to really make sure we knew the material. Also, the time given was very helpful
because I was able to focus on the material and not a time constraint."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Through his lectures, I learned a lot."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He showed methods to problems I didn't know about and expanded how I went about each problem
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Ways instructor Romulo Neves Ely encouraged my intellectual growth and progress is giving flexible class schedules to work on
our assignment."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He was clear and understanding. He showed interest in teaching and always there for help
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Even though the lectures were all asynchronous, it was easy to tell that the professor was passionate and enthusiastic about what
he was teaching."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"This course has helped me develop my skills on operations, as well as using different tools such as Excel to solve problems"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Made me learn task prioritization a little bit better, along with time management, I feel that some of the content of this class is useful
in real world business practices."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Yes, Rumulo always encourages us and lets us have critical thinking!"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"By continuously pushing us to study the material until its mastered, he wants to see every student succeed"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Mr. Ely inhibited my interaction with this course due to the confusing nature of its organization, and has led me to have little to no
course engagement, and no motive to learn the material."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"Needs to be more organized, there are a lot of things that he puts on canvas that does not need to be there which clutters the overall
organization of the class making it harder to find the material needed for the class."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He is really great at helping you understand and is always willing to answer questions.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,The lecture recording is helpful
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Challenged me with material very new and unfamiliar to me.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"– The material was really interesting
– The complementary materials provided were very detailed, thorough
– I really enjoyed the lectures"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Professor Neves has guided me to learn more quantitative skills with tools such as Excel preparing me for future courses.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He is passionate about the topic which passes onto the students
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"The professor explains pretty well the concepts. The lectures can be a bit long–winded, which can confuse people."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Helped me think out of the box.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Have a couple mandatory classes to make sure students are on task
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Went above and beyond to make sure we understand the material
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I really enjoyed the thorough explanations throughout the lectures and grew my knowledge on how to add value during specific
situations in business."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He was super helpful with all questions. I liked how he would record office hours so we can watch it at a later date.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,Very responsive and detailed in his explanations about the material. Very excited about his subject.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,He was quick in response to questions
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"I think the way the professor ran the class was great since it was asych. However, it would have been more beneficial for live
lectures as it allows students to have a more organized schedule of watching lecture."

S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,growth,"the monthly homework and specific video lectures, but the ppt not as well as video lectures did"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,I suggest professor Ely separate each lecture material on Canvas Module rather than making a big list.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"In terms of the Canvas materials, I feel that using folders to contain all the videos in one folder for the week in the module, and a
separate folder for the complementary materials for that module would make the organization a little better."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"I did not like the asynchronous learning format. The material we learned in this class was complex and requires focus. It would
have been most effective if the class was synchronous."

The Wednesday time slot was tricky as I planned my work schedule around an 8:40–10:00 class not knowing this time slot would never be used for any synchronous material."

S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Overall enjoyed the course, the subject matter, and felt that the prof. did a good job at teaching the material."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"The modules are organized but the amount of material provided exceeded all my other courses combined. Coupled with the
textbook, I spent more time on this course yet due to information overload don't feel I retained as much as I hoped. I think it was just
too much material, being virtual, and no access to a tutoring center or group studying to help reinforce the material."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,Overall a good class

S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"for the lectures i think it would have been better to make them a little shorter and straight to the point. while i did learn a lot i feel like
a lot of the info was extra stuff that diverted my attention from the most important points"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,Some of the lectures were kind of hard to put into practice/action because they involved procedures of excel.
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Good course, helpful, and recitations help a lot!!"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"On canvas, I believe the lectures could be better organized into separate modules. This will make it easier to find the relevant
material faster."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,none
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,The above is all!
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Providing the Excel's with the work already done was helpful, but in the future teaching us how to input it ourselves would help more.
We used to do that in the beginning of the course then stopped, now when I try to enter it on my own it doesn't work out for me
leading to the decline in my grades. I try to refer to previous lectures to help with this but there is just way too many recordings and
not enough time to go through all and effectively understand the material not to mention students take 16–20 credits per semester"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"I really hope that in the future if an overwhelming percent of students get a question wrong points would be awarded to them. In
cases like these, I feel as though a majority of students would have gotten a question wrong either because they did not understand
the wording of it or because it explored concepts not sufficiently explained in the lecture and recitation. In addition to this, I feel as
though it would solve the issues where students, TAs, and you are arguing on technicalities of questions and the intent of the
question."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Also, this class was honestly more annoying than I expected bc someone told me they did only algebra in ops mgmt, but this was
so much more than expected and not interesting"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Please fix your quizzes. The answers tend to be wrong requiring a regrade. Just the way the quizzes are made, it is clear that the
professor just wants to trip up students. Also, I would suggest remaking your videos as the have many errors that also create more
stress for students. Add more assignments to balance out the grades. To heavy on the quizzes that confuse students anyways."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"I would better organize the course material. A lot of helpful material was posted to the site, but was not packaged all too neatly. For
example, if a student was to look for the powerpoint slides for a certain section, it was a bit difficult to locate due to the sheet amount
of resources posted under each section. Material was all helpful and relevant, but hard to locate"
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,None
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"In the future, it would be nice if the professor would give a sequence of word problems to practice for the exam, to make sure we are
able to prepare for them."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Some of the problems on the homeworks/tests were worded in a way that led to confusion. I understand that we can't always go back to review questions, but it was extra hard when the question was worded where two answers essentially mean the same
thing, but you can't go back and review it, too. And the professor sort of worked with the students, but also changed the grades
multiple times over two–three weeks so it was stressful and confusing to figure out what was actually happening."

S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Overall, great course"

is what it is missing a bit."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,maybe post the information about the final exam earlier
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Overall, it was a good class and I was able to learn a lot."
S2021-ALL,2021,Spring,other,"Learning material from this course and other RBS courses on YouTube instead of a easy to learn lecture is NOT a good reputation.
There should be a reform to the delivery of material, because YouTube is more popular as a learning method than the actual course
materials being paid for by the tuition."

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,It’s over now
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the recording of every class
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Using excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The subject matter was good
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Exposure to excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,some of the questions posed were interesting to solve.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,All assignments were organized and I clearly knew what I had to complete.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked how it was very structured with homework being assigned every so often and having a certain amount of time to complete it.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked the practical use of Excel and application to real–world problems
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Responsiveness of the professor
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Well structured
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"The TA's lectures were integral in helping me understand course material. They were able to cover the same material as the
professor's lectures in less than 1/3 of the time"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like how he would post the answers to the homework after it is graded. Therefore students can see what they did wrong for the
homework."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked that I could use excel and master it with the business–related problems that were provided in his class.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked that this course was asynchronous because I could fit it into my at–home schedule.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I really liked the material, I thought it was quite interesting."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Everything
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,We used excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"My favorite thing about the course is the multitude of materials the professor provides to help us learn the programming and
mathematical skills on our own."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The homeworks were relatively fair. the content was straight forward
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The course has excellent TAs who really simplify the material and provide a holistic environment for the students to thrive in.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"Certain chapters were very interesting, such as the subject of constraints."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like the conceptual questions on the homework and quizzes.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The material appears to be useful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,What I liked best about the course was how there was a sufficient amount of time for each homework
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The course provides a well–rounded introduction to linear programming aided by software.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The knowledge learned is very interesting and I have always been a math person so I was engaged from the beginning.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The HW assignments
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like how it is very student taught.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Only 4 assignments and 1 final exam
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Flexibility
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"TAs are great at explaining course material through examples. Slides are helpful by including examples. Homeworks/online tests
are reflective of the exact material reviewed in class."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The TA's were very helpful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,All the assignments were explained thoroughly
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I really enjoyed the TA recitations because they allowed me to gain clarity on topics that may have been a bit unclear in the lectures.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked this course being online very much. prefer this course online rather than inperson
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"The homework’s were fair and doable, recitations were also great."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The analytical skills gained from problem–solving on Excel.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The ta’s were really helpful in understanding the material.

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Learning about excel solving
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The TAs
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I thought that the homework kept us on track and steadily increased from what we learned previously to the next very effectively.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,recorded lectures make it easy to spend time learning on your own and go back through certain problems for practice.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the analytical thinking
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"He was so understanding to just about everything and gave us time to think out problems. The amount of time and understanding
he gave elevated the pressures of a normal class"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the TA recitations were incredibly helpful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,It taught me a lot about the operational aspects of a business.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Simple and fair grading system.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked that we were given the freedom to work on the lecture material at our own pace.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The time on the tests
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Finishing it.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Lots of real–world examples which made this class practical.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"The material was relatively easy, but I was still able to learn a lot. This is probably because of the instructor's teaching methods."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,m
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,TAs were very helpful.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the professor
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The TAs were very helpful in assisting with the material.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,videos were easy to follow along and helpful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked problem solving based on real life scenarios. I also liked that the professor is really fair and answers questions thoroughly.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Fair amount of assignments
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The challenge of it. It is not an easy course but it was fun.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"the TAs recitations were extremely helpful and I appreciated Professor Ely adding optional supplemental materials (so students
could dive deeper into the topics if they wanted to)"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The fairness in grading and course load was very manageable.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked how there was a strong effort to implement more practice with excel in the course.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked the way the material was delivered despite the setbacks due to covid.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I liked the layout of the class and how the professor communicated with us each week. I also liked the layout of the homework
assignments."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Not stressful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like the fact that the things I learn in excel can really benefit myself in the future
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,it was asynchronous but had TAs to help.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,quantitative techniques
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The Professor and TA's were easily accessible and responded to all questions in an efficient and timely manner.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Learning new things that I did not have knowledge on prior.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,doing math
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The TAs
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I have never once had this understanding of a professor. He drops questions from the overall grade if a majority of students get the
answer wrong & gives us the most time he's able to give on timed assignments. Absolutely wonderful!"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The professor was very flexible with the Covid crisis and understanding.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked how it was asynchronous.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I learned a lot of useful information
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Well put together for an online course the TAs especially
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,It did not take a long time to understand the material
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like the recitations.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked how we had recitations that matched and provided example problems
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The ability to learn about modeling and apply them to different problems. The short videos also helped with learning the material.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like the variety of topics we studied, and the structure of the course."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The application of the material to real life situations.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Interesting content that the professor and teaching assistants made easy to understand
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like mathematical programming. I think it's a useful skill for all businesses and it helps drive so many decisions I did not think
about. The structure of the class is also quite helpful as I get quite a bit of practice every 2 or 3 weeks."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The TAs were very helpful and open to helping students.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the lectures were very thorough and helped take the homework assignments and exam.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"–There were plenty of resources to learn the material from the YouTube videos, the prof's videos, and 2 TA videos
–Plenty of time on assignment and the assignments are application which really tests if we are understanding the material"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The material is interesting and solving the problems is challenging but rewarding
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Teacher
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like how helpful the Tas were at answering questions and helping us learn the material. Also, I like how the video lectures were
broken up so that it wasn’t super long lecture videos."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The ability to become more proficient in excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"The professor's teaching style and how much it adjusted to online learning. Some of my other classes make absolutely no attempt
to adjust to online learning but this class really did."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the way the professors and TAs worked together to make the class more approachable
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,There was a lot of time given for assignments to be completed
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,recorded lectures
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,––
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Professor explains everything clearly
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Lectures were overall pretty clear
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like that each lesson adds on to the previous one.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"My TA, Sapan Shah, was incredibly helpful. Really appreciated all the work he put in."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The way the recitations explained concepts I was not 100% with
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The straightforward explanations
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like how the professor always looks back at the Hw questions and gives back points if he thought it was unfair or the problem was
not worded correctly."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I learned a lot about the subject and it felt engaging.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,videos were pretty organized
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,asynchronous learning provided great flexibility for me in taking this course.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The recitations with the TAs
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"The flexibility of the online course but came with a tradeoff. I liked the clear instructions for the exam and lectures and recitations.
Appreciated the workload as it was only for a few weeks, so it was easier to manage."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I liked that the class was asynchronous and that the coursework was manageable. I also found the TA classes very helpful.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,How accessible it was
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"Learning how businesses understand the most in how to make decisions about production provided info about the costs of
business and the environment it is involved in."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The subject at hand
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I like that there were many resources to use, including the professors lectures and the recitations of 2 TAs that you could use
depending on what was most helpful to you. I also like that things were organized."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,lectures and putting my knowledge to use on homeworks
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,TAs are really helpful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,Excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I didn't like the course the exams were extremely difficult and there were no problems seen on the exam that were in any lectures.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"Manageable work load. Professor did not overwhelm us with work, and with how different the world and school is because of the
pandemic, I really appreciated it."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,The grading structure
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,good lecture
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,his straightforwardness
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,"I liked the professors way of leaving the work up to us, but it did set me back at times."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I like how we had a week to do the homeworks and were given a large time slot to complete it.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,the material and the TAs are good
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,I appreciate how it has a practical use in the job I plan on getting after ocllege.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,best,very helpful for major
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,The tests were confusingly worded at some parts which made it hard to answer since I was not fully sure what was being asked
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Keep it up
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would try to trim down the material into just the most essential parts
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"More organized Canvas site. More efficient lectures. Every week has about 20 hours of content, of which 10 hours isn't necessary.
But it's impossible to tell which is and isn't."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would create more homework assignments so that we could frequently be graded on progress
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I may increase the discussion room.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,better communication
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would make the video lectures more concise. They videos were to elongated with made them harder to follow along with and a
little boring."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Nothing, Romulo did great for teaching in a virtual environment"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Make the lecture videos a but shorter. Sometimes there's a lot and they're long so it seems difficult to get through when you have
other classes as well."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I think the course having been instructed via asynchronous learning proved to be the most difficult aspect of it. If possible, I'd have
done synchronous lectures."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would recommend keeping optional materials perhaps separated from the required videos and files. Sometimes I found it hard to
navigate to find the required links among all the optional links."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I wouldn't do anything differently besides exams because there was no backtracking and some questions were very challenging.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would have included some live sessions, I felt like as a student it was easy to get lost in this course as the schedule changed
around a bit and the lectures were all prerecorded."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,would allow students to go back on homework and open it for a longe amount of time not just a 7 minute window
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Hope that it is in person
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Have in person instruction (not the fault of Romulo)
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would try to lessen the impact of just Homeworks, or Tests that determine your entire course grade and also create more effective
teaching methods other than just posted lecture videos"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"The modules section of canvas is very confusing as there are so many different options to pick from. Instead, you need to make
more folders so that we can close tabs that are not needed anymore. Also complementary material should have their own section
so it is less confusing. Finally, some of the wording on the quizzes made me second guess my answers multiple time and would
take a lot longer than needed due to the wording."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would provide more practice problems and review guides.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I will add more examples for each question.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Not be all online and asynchronous
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,It's already good enough.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Maybe get to the point quicker and more clearly
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would probably shorten the lecture videos. Also, I would make the quiz questions more clear."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Teach it in person
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"organize the material better on canvas. Feel free to include complementary learning material but place it in another folder so that it
does not come before the actual required material."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would not include ""none of the above"" as an answer option on exams, or at least not for every question."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Split the lecture material into more modules.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,sometimes it was hard to stay up to date with all the lecture videos so something to encourage students to stay on track.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would use the Media Gallery feature to put lecture videos instead of hosting all the videos on Box. I would also include a separate
tab for complimentary material so I can more easily look for lecture material within the Modules section."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"No pre recorded lectures. Especially if the instructor keeps the same format. It was extremely confusing starting the week on the day
we have class instead of sunday. Also, no one needs that much complimentary material. sending out a bunch of links is not going
to help. I am positive that most kids did not even watch the instructor's lectures, just waited for the TA's recitations."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"THIS CLASS SHOULD NOT BE ASYNCHRONOUS. The uploaded lectures and lack of structure led the professor to upload hours
and hours of lecture content. Live, scheduled lectures should be in place where the professor only provides the needed information.
The class is disorganized and expectations are unclear."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Rather than explaining more than what is needed for each lecture, I would shorten the lecture and teach the students what is
needed."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would make it easier to allow students to privately ask questions related to the material.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Please make this class synchronous (and MIS too!). It's so hard to keep up with the material and learning from videos just isn't the
same as learning during live lectures. Also, the asynchronous videos are way too long to keep up with – I understand wanting to go
into detail but at this point they're impossible to watch. I rely more on the recitation videos and reading the textbook chapters to
understand the class material (which totally works too honestly)"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Not as much material and focus on the important lessons in the class. Quality over quantity
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"If I were teaching this course, I would assign more homework assignment, but that which are more closely spaced out and count
for less of a percentage of the student's total grade. As the class currently stands. One bad homework grade is very punishing."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Maybe cut out some of the fat in the lectures
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would add one live session on Zoom/Webex a week because work piles up pretty quickly in this class.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Would not change
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I did not like the asynchronous learning. I wish there were scheduled classes to keep myself accountable for the work. It was very
difficult and stressful without a meeting time."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Have live teaching sessions instead of videos
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Have synchronous lectures in this online format.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I'd like it to be in person lol
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,If I were teaching this course I would get rid of the none of the above questions
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would want students to understand the concepts behind the LP algorithms that are taken for granted in this course. The simplex
method is used to solve almost all of the course's problems in Excel and should be understood."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would make the lecture videos shorter and more concise. The video lectures were often very long and longer than if we were
having a normal in–person class/lecture."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would make longer videos instead of many short videos.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would consider live lectures
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,more homework assignments and grades.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"If I was teaching the course, I would focus on having more questions that simulate the homework assignments. The class
problems were usually much different than the homework"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would organize the material better.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Lectures are way too dense and long. Also super boring
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I think smaller assignments to check our progress would have been more beneficial than our grade being dictated by 4 exams and
a final"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"–I think the lecture videos should be condensed a little more so we don't have to watch 10–15 videos each week
–sometimes the questions on the quizzes were worded in a confusing manner"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"If I was the professor I would cut it down to 3HW's, I find it useless to just have one HW with one Lecture in it. Also, there were some
ways the TA's completed problems that seemed easier than how the Professor explained it. Maybe the professor can work with
them to see what is easier for the students."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Personally I would try to spread the HW assignments out. I felt like the first one took a while to get to and then it was pretty much
every other week we had one."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Romulo should list the videos and material on Canvas more neatly and grouped in a more organized fashion. It is easy to miss a
video."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"My only problem is the laundry list of things placed on the canvas modules section. There are so many files as needed it was quite
overwhelming seeing all of them in one list, if they were organized into sections better I would’ve used the materials more from the start."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would provide more practice problems beforehand to show what material will be covered on each homework.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Add more practice problems
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,teach synchronously
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Make only two videos for each lecture instead of 10 and have one live session per week
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Done more assignments, rather than exams"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Something I would do differently is to have fewer links within Canvas. Although I thought it was well organized according to the
lectures, I found that there were many links including complementary material and excel files that were difficult to manage."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,actually set up zoom or webex calls because it is a hard subject to teach yourself
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"The only dispute of would have is with the exam and being more clear. I would assume these differences though are because of
you making it from scratch. Reading certain questions to get the full understanding is probably what took the most time."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would offer more videos.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Be more organized on Canvas and have TAs use their own canvas course.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Possibly make the lecture videos a bit more concise.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Organize the modules/chapters better so it was clearly seperated
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I don’t know I’m not a teacher for this reason.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would organize the lecture material better. Most professors create modules by week or by lecture, but Professor Romulo put
everything under one module so it was very difficult navigating and finding the specific material that I needed"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would probably try to stick to the syllabus in terms of assigning homework due dates.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,k
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,actually get on zoom and do your job this class is too hard to not teach it.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Shorter lecture videos
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,be more engaged
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Canvas was very disorganized and it was hard to follow the course information. The professor also struggled with explaining the
exact reason why we were learning what we were learning and how we would apply the material to our careers."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I understand the virtual environment being a challenge for many, however, I wish this class was synchronous. Some of the lecture
videos were too long in my opinion and made me lose interest sometimes."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would do LIVE classes! It is so much easier to learn in synchronous classes than asynchronous.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Live lecture. This is hard content so it definitely would make more sense to do live so people can ask questions in that moment
rather than on the discussion board."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Keep materials all on one platform (not on Drive, Groupme, Zoom, and Canvas), keep Canvas more organized overall (organized by
week with checklist format?)"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Upload the proper amount of work– Professor Ely would sometimes post 5 hours of material when this is only a 3 credit class. The
subject of this course is so niche and random I have no idea why all business students are required to take it. As a marketing major
I am able to create connections between the finance classes, accounting classes, and economics classes I've taken. However, with
this class I have not once understood why it is important for me to take this class. It felt like a complete waste of time and money. In
addition, Professor Romulo was extremely unhelpful when I reached out to him. He would upload 50 links to Canvas and it would
be extremely difficult to keep track of what we had to complete for the week. When I reached out to him seeing if the Canvas
modules page could be organized better, he shot me down and did nothing. When I asked him for an extension on a quiz because I
had COVID, he did not grant me an extension because ""I wouldn't be able to go back and look at my answers If I did the quiz after
the due date"" and advised me to take the quiz while I was sick with the coronavirus. I hated this class"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Probably spread out the assignments more evenly over the course of the semester rather than having it be heavy later on.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Considering the circumstances with Covid, I would not do much differently."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Provide lectures that correlated to the homework. The recitations were also very different than the homeworks.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Reduce exam difficulty.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Drop lowest hw
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would get rid of some of the complementary material to reduce clutter. Or make a seperate folder with the complementary material
provided."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would have periodically created additional discussions on canvas so that people could find questions more easily rather than
scrolling to the bottom"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Make questions Less confusing by adding less “none of the above” options
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Video announcements were lengthy. I think important announcements should have been posted with just text.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would add in some homework assignemnts so the entire grad eisn't based on just exams
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Have atleast one synchronous class
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,reduce the reliance on excel as this isn't meant to a serious course and instead focus on concepts
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,more assignments
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Maybe encourage students to participate more– it's easy to fall behind when class is asynchronous.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Do the class live
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,More explanations for excel
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I'd post lecture recordings to Canvas rather than Box, as it seems Box sometimes forces him to post a 3–hour lecture in 20–minute
segments, which is kind of a pain to navigate."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Maybe have biweekly homework on Pearson or another source so we can keep up on a more regular basis.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would have weekly checkpoints to make sure students were up to date with the weekly material.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,have a designated meeting time
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Assign more assignments and tests to gauge how well I'm doing at retaining information.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Provided less material in the module section that we were not tested on. Made finding the important slides hard to do
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would change the questions on the homework so they
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would do problems by hand and split up the videos more to organize
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Try to break the class into smaller groups of students and offer hybrid format of synchronous teaching and also asynchronous
practice sessions with the TAs help."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I think a synchronous class would have helped motivate me and other students to keep up with the material better.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"More organized notes, rewatching lectures and recitations the material was not organized too well."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would organize the content better on the Canvas site because sometimes it was hard to find things and there were a lot of links
under one lecture. The lectures in terms of time were a lot so I would try to cut it down a little bit."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"This course is great. I would think about incorporate a Monte Carlo project for students, most likely extra credit, in which students
will apply the knowledge from the Monte Carlo and Simulation lecture, and conduct their own experiment. It would be interesting to
see what they can do. But, this course and the professor have helped a lot! Thanks!"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,organize the class material better on canvas
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"–I disliked the website that held all the viedos (RU App Box?), it crashed often and would just stop in the middle of the video.
Refreshing it does help but I think moving to youtube would be better and changing the privacy setting to ""unlisted"" makes it so it is
unsearchable and not seen to the public. Only people with the link can watch the video"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Different folders to make finding files and lectures easier
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Less homework tests

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Attendance should be mandatory
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I wouldnt make the homeworks so difficult
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,––
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Shorter lectures
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Don't do it asynchronously
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I did not like how the lectures were released randomly and that each lesson was about 8 parts that were 20–30 minutes each. It
would be easier for the students to assign the lectures on the same day each week."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would organize all the videos (lectures and recitations) in two folders that is easily accessible and provide more practice questions
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would like to go over the theory a bit more
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would add Hw that are less weighted so we can do well on the heavily weighted four
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would provide more videos that demonstrate how to navigate through a problem.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,The subject matter needs to be communicated better
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Give more examples of doing problems and more similar problems to the HW and exams
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"The asynchronous environment really negatively impacted the way I learned and studied the material. Like most people, I just
viewed the lectures/recitations a few days before the exam. The lectures were a bit long – 1 problem took 1 hour to solve. So maybe
shortening them to focus on the main aspects that will be tested on. Also, the exams were not that well–connected to the material.
For example, the 2nd homework had some problems that either were not fully covered or not covered at all. For this exam, all the
lectures and videos focused on using excel where the exam did not use excel really. Also, the learning curve is a bit high for
someone who struggled with Calc 1 and stats and I never really used excel before so it was a lot for me to learn and relearn. This
caused me a bit of stress while studying for exams as well because I always felt somewhat behind. I understand that some exam
questions were conceptual but the lectures were not really that conceptual so he could definitely go over those concepts a lot more.
Also, exam questions could be a lot more clearer in terms of wording."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would set due dates clearly on the syllabus instead of giving a range of dates.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"more chances for grades, LIVE LECTURES"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would make things a little more interactive. I get things are online and that tough to accommodate but it was hard to understand
concepts"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I wouldn’t change anything
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"maybe make homework a little easier, i felt that it was a little too difficult and mainly based on the hardest of the examples we saw"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,teach more and provide more materials and helps
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,No answer choice for none of the above on quizzes
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"I would have some office hours to go over some problems that are similar with the exams. Have more communication between the
TAs and teacher."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Nothing,"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,no
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would have weekly mandatory sessions to make sure everyone is on track.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,"Maybe have some small easy quizzes in between each big HW assignment, so the students won't feel scared about messing up
the HW and actually test their knowledge before the big grades"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,I would do nothing diffrently.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,change,taught in person
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"He seems to genuinely want to help students so it makes it motivating to want to do better since the resources are there if you need
them"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Maybe a little bit less ""plug and chug"""
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"good professor, definitely don't fire him"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Encouragement.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,he was very understanding
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The professor is very nice and throughly explains each topic to the best of his ability.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"His enthusiasm, and his helpful, responsive TAs."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The lectures video
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely gave us a multitude of resources to learn from and was readily available for help when needed. Really helped me
learn a great deal in this class."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Prof Ely's timely video messages and emails help me tremendously to learn linear programming.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,His lecture videos were very in depth.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,General Engagement with the subject – hard to encourage over online learning
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He has given students plenty of resources to succeed
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He actively posts announcement and homework in an organized manner to eliminate additional stress.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Being able to choose between virtual recitation or video recitation was very helpful as I had more options to pick from when
attending."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Professor explains the details very well
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,This class shouldn’t be asynchronous. I’m just teaching myself everything.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,His course is clear and helpful.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Used excel a lot which is a important tool
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Before taking ops management I didn't think I would like the subject, but it became more interesting as I learned more"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Just better organization of the materials and the syllabus. Dates were changed a lot for homework’s.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Lectures were very enthusiastic about the subject.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The professor was enthusiastic while going through lectures and course materials.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"The disorganization of the Canvas page and the lecture videos made it hard for me to learn because I had to dig through dozens of
links to find the correct problem link. This also occurred for the lecture videos since lectures would sometimes inexplicably be split
into 8 different videos which makes them hard to watch and go back to reference when studying."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He has been very helpful and always responsive to questions.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Very great professor
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"This course challenged my understanding of how to use excel and solve complicated business problems. This semester has been
a challenge because the classes overall are much more difficult than at my previous school and the level of difficulty requires me to
study more than I had to at my previous school."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,I learned much more about Excel which is a very useful tool.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Lots of detail!
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,There was a lot of material to learn in a very short period of time
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"This course was challenging for me, but the instructor's flexibility and emphasis on learning skills encouraged me greatly to spend
extra time mastering the material."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"A lot of people didn't like his lectures, I loved them. He did a good job bringing relevant examples to the content being learned"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I have not had any interactions with the professor himself due to the online mode of instruction but reading through the professor's
responses on the discussion forum, I can tell he is dedicated to the betterment of his students."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The professor made himself very available to speak to and ask for help.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,he was interested in the material and had helpful resources like the Teacher Assistance
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,His videos were excellent and easy to understand
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He also responded to any questions in a very kind and helpful manner.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo was good at communicating the goals for each student for the course. He made clear what was necessary to
succeed in the course"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,N/A
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely provided ample practice questions to prepare us for each section exam. Exam questions were not computationally
difficult but instead focused on conceptual understanding."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"He tells you from the beginning of the course that it is okay to fail, just as long as you learn from it. This is just such great advice as I
always strive to be perfect and get the best grades possible."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The course recordings were thorough and detailed.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He made the course interesting and relatable which resulted in more interaction and awareness of the material being taught.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"He is really nice and fair, great professor"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Helped me with operations management
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"This class has allowed me to gain confidence in excel in a way that I think will benefit me in the future. I have also been able to work
on my critical thinking skills."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,My skills in excel have improved which will certainly help me going forward.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"He often connects lecture material to real–life examples, so I have been able to apply linear programming to my own field of
marketing."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Ely has listened to all students issues and has been very understanding in this new class room experience.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Giving us multiple streams of content and people to go to when having questions encourages us to learn.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,I got to learn how to think more critically and analytically
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He forced me to think outside the box and not be a robot to answering the same questions over and over
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He makes sure all his students understand the material and answers our questions when we don’t
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,It allowed me to gain a better understanding of Excel and how to use Excel for real life scenarios
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Made me really apply my skills I learned from the notes to use on the homework.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Challenging course especially with online lectures.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He adds a lot of complementary material that is interesting to learn about as it involves real world examples often.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,njkn
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Good as is. Maybe shorter lecture videos they are really long.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,the material
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"He is so excited and passionate about the material, it is amazing. The math itself was not new to me, but the method of thinking
was very interesting."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,helpful lectures and consistent homework
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo did a great job of asking questions in assignments that were challenging, but in the best ways possible
considering the foundation of course content had already learned."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Please get lowest grade dropped, extremely difficult taking online"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely encouraged the growth of all students within and outside this course. He encouraged students to learn from their
mistakes and keep growing their knowledge."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Professor Ely was always willing to respond to student questions and did so right away. He was willing to admit any mistakes and
make any necessary changes"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I think this is a very difficult to teach via online, however the TA's specifically Sapan were extremely helpful and were almost like
Romulo's ""right hand man"""
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"His recorded lectures take way too long to the point that whatever content he had been teaching is lost in the void due to a lack of
brevity."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I could tell that the Professor was very passionate in his teachings because he went above and beyond just the minimum; for
example, by providing a handful of additional supplements."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I found it a bit difficult to take a asynchronous class, but Romulo was very descriptive in his videos"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,operations management
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He has encouraged us to work through difficult problems and to think outside of the box.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The course not meeting at all besides recitation was quite difficult
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He clearly explains the material
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Professor Ely does a good job explaining concepts.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"This course helped me to apply my calculus and math skills to model different scenarios in maximizing profits and minimizing
costs etc in linear and non–linear problems and situations. Introduced an understanding of the importance of modeling in decision
making."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Very respectful, lenient and overall good teacher"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,I learned a lot about how to use Excel and different topics regarding operations management that I did not know before.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He has helped me understand underlying concepts rather than just teaching us the process.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I think the professor’s positive attitude and deep understanding of the concepts helped me understand them very well. He took his
time to explain every detail and repeated it to reinforce important concepts, which was very helpful."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I enjoyed the class all over. I enjoyed integer programming quite a bit. It's interesting to see so much math and excel used in the
business world. I am grateful to the professor, TAs, and RBS for providing a great class."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He added a vast amount of complementary material to help students understand the lessons and subjects.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Great!
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Very nice professor who is timely and gives enough notice.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"The homework were amazing practice and I appreciated how if the wording was strange or could be interpreted multiple ways,
Professor Ely was accommodating. I also have a very busy schedule, so I appreciated the time span the homeworks were available
in, so I could plan accordingly."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I like how professor Neves always announced the quizzes/homework assignments ahead of time and gave us ample time to do
them in order to best accommodate our schedules. I appreciated this since the online learning environment has been very hectic
and stressful."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Professor Ely was extremely responsive and made sure we had all the resources at our disposal to get the most out of the course.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Talk about a guy who is genuinely passionate about both engaging with his students and about the material itself. Could not ask for
a better professor"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"he was always so welcoming and understanding during office hours. despite the remote instruction, he taught this class very well
to students despite the complexity of the subject matter"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Attendance should have been mandatory or worth extra points for incentivization
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,none
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,–
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Can announce thing through posts not always 10 minute videos
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Have more assignments due throughout, instead of having only 4, so there is consistency and understanding"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Towards the beginning of the semester, I liked how he explained how to prepare for the homework assignments."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Rather than sending out written announcements, he send video announcement that were very thorough and brought back a bit of
normalcy to online learning."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,I believe that the examples given were very well picked as they apply to interests of many business school students.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,I would thank Professor Ely for always keeping a positive attitude throughout the semester.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He has generated interest in the use of technology to solve business problems.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Great Professor.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"Made me learn how to use Excel more and become a bit more confident in it and value the TA resources. The exams made me
focus more and study harder."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Just make a different module for every lecture. So student doesn't have to scroll down every time.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"I liked how Professor Ely explained many concepts and nuances in his course videos clearly and thoroughly. It allowed me to have a
better understanding of the material in the course."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Very helpful
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He gave us extra material in case we wanted to go deeper on the subject we were learning
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He made me interested in the material and provided several resources that made it easy to understand.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,Professor was cool and did a great job allowing us to take advantage of online format and flexibility
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,The grading rule is extremely horrible
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,It has not brought any intellectual growth.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"the man, simple"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"My professor’a detailed videos were very well put together and organized so that online classes were easier to take and
understand."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,"His teaching is clear and organized, and I like it that way"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,growth,He provided lots of content to further our understanding of concepts.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"This course is very problem intensive, with too many examples to keep track of"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,None.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"Overall, professor Neves was straight forward with how the course would run and gave us adequate time to learn the material
before the following homework assignments."

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Nothing
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"I think because of the pandemic and remote instruction, it’s really hard to create anything similar to what the course should actually
be like and it makes everything a LOT harder. I also feel like professors are assigning more work in hopes it helps us learn but
honestly it just adds more stress and it becomes harder to keep up especially given the circumstances, seasonal depression, and
the general affect this pandemic has on mental health."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,n/a
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"I felt the content and exams were sometimes difficult to follow and unorganized for how it was making up the majority of our course

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"This class was conducted better than most of my other classes. Thank you! Have a wonderful break, stay safe"
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Maybe have smaller assignments in between the major homework’s
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"Honestly, I had a hard time looking at every single lecture video as they were very long. I mostly relied on recitations and that
seemed good enough. Also, I think some HW questions were tricky and poorly worded."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,I found that the TAs prepared me best for the biweekly homework assignments.
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Professor is fair in grading the assignments. TA's really good.

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"It was hard for me to go back and study a particular because there were so many lecture videos. The Canvas page was incredibly
disorganized and it made it hard sifting through all the material to get to the lecture videos/problems/etc."

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Great experience 10/10
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"While watching the lecture videos, I realized that the professor likes to explain more in–depth or go beyond what is needed for us to
know for some of the concepts/topics. I understand that he is doing this to help us understand the topic more, however, sometimes,
I get confused. Therefore, I believe that it would be easier if the professor teaches on just what is needed and get straight to the
point."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"I think organizing Canvas in a different manner may be more beneficial to students. For instance, instead of having one module with
all of the lectures in it, I would recommend creating separate modules for each lecture."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,None
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"This course and its instructor has a very good model of implementing an open discussion board where students can directly

F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Great teacher even better guy!
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,"I would suggest that content on Canvas be organized into separate modules, instead of one. It was a bit cumbersome to scroll all the way down to access later content. Also, I feel the lecture videos could be shorter and a bit more condense. There were multiple videos (some near 30 min) and I didn't
have the time to view them all because they were all so long."
F2020-ALL,2020,Fall,other,Class was well taught and I learned a lot

S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,I would try to provide more resources just in case people need more aid.
S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,"Especially with remote teaching, I would incorporate some basic assignments with Excel. I think it would be beneficial for students
to leave with some linear programming skills with Excel."
S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,"To have more students practice the problems than just giving them theory and knowledge of material, hence if necessary reduce the
amount of material being taught"

S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,I would swtich to excel for the whole course
S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,"I would make the lecture slides more thorough and add solutions to them. I came to class every morning and wrote them down, but
it was hard to read my answers. In addition, it would be great if the lecture slides were more concept based and went over the
procedures needed to solve. But overall, I enjoyed the class, even though I did poorly on the online tests, despite studying."
S2020-21,2020,Spring,change,I would change the online exams so that students are able to go back to previous questions.
S2020-21,2020,Spring,growth,He continued to hold office hours frequently for each section even when it became difficult online so i really appreciate that
S2020-21,2020,Spring,growth,He went into depth describing how to solve problems. I found this helpful because I was able to understand the material better.

S2020-20,2020,Spring,best,"Professor was great at teaching the material. He always made sure that we were following along, and despite lack of class
participation, made the learning experience enjoyable. It became harder for me to learn effectively after we went online because I
became demotivated and because the professor opted for videos instead of live meetings, I started to fall behind. This is not the
professor's fault, but more just because of the current circumstances. His videos likely proved more beneficial to students because
of replayablity."
S2020-20,2020,Spring,best,Very straightforward and examples were pretty clear.

S2020-20,2020,Spring,change,"More examples and easier interface. The excel examples would be partially done and we would have to jump into it in the middle. If
we had to design and build excel sheets i think it would have helped us understand it better, even though this course was not
primarily about excel."

where we were able to learn a lot more information."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,best,the online exams
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,best,"Recitations with Katerina, she taught very well. Unfortunately remote instruction chopped up the good parts of all of my classes and utterly destroyed them."

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,best,The manner in which lectures were organized.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I think I would present the material in a more organized manner and straight forward. Sometimes things were confusing.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Be more clear on material
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Easy tests so students can actually learn and not burden up by learning each and every concept
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,The grade distribution is ridiuclous.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,More homework assignments to help up with practice
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would post more supplementary examples to help study
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I might force attendance
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Considering the way the class is set up I don't think I would do anything differently.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would focus more on what happens during recitation during the actual lecture. The lecture was focused more on conceptual
understanding usually supported with one or two very long examples. Yet, in recitation that's where we learned how to actually solve
problems that were relevant to our exams and so I feel that is more important to me as a student trying to do well in the course. If
instead we did things like that during the lecture and focused more on concepts in recitation I think it would be to the greater benefit
of the students."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,A little bit more time towards the basic concept explanations instead of example questions.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Provide hws to make sure the learning is being implemented prior to the Online tests.

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,N/A
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"More grades, homework to help learn."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,A lot. Would work on concepts then problems at a quicker rate. Hold students more accountable to show up to class.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"It is difficult to just have grade based on exams in which you cannot backtrack, it sometimes causes mistakes that the student
would otherwise know."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Possibly mandatory classes
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would restructure the course to focus more on real world connection rather than analysis. I don't think I will use the concepts I
learned in this course at a job because they are very granular and focused on isolated math analysis. RBS should re–evaluate this
course to focus more on company's efficiency with relevant softwares, etc. Maybe data analysis or statistical modeling software
should be the focus of this course. I do not think this reflects poorly on the instructor or his motivation at all, but at the same time–– I
do not think this class is very relevant to a business education. The professor does a great job teaching the material however."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,More group assignments
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,idk
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would have other assignments to assess student's understanding besides just the online test. Also, I would provide more practice
problems because it seems like we would only have one example of each different type of problem we did."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would try to give as many examples as possible because that is the best way to learn in accordance with math.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"Occasionally we had multiple lectures covering one problem, which I felt didn’t necessarily help our intellectual growth in the best
manner."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I think that there could be lecture live for after the coronavirus came around.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"Do more examples with different numbers for each type of problem. If I was the teacher, I would give the recitation TA's different
problems to work on instead of going over the same ones in the lectures."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I think the course is sufficient as it is.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"Add some sort of homework other than the online tests. It does not have to be alot, maybe replace one OT with 15% of homework."

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"make a qualification test to ensure students know how to do basic algebra before taking the course. A lot of time in lectures was
wasted answering questions not related to the content but towards the application of math concepts learned in middle school."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"If I was teaching this course, I would probably give homework assignments. I think it would be the best way to help students further
learn the material. Personally, I learn better when I'm given homework and get to practice it a couple times."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Fewer materials to read
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I'd make more assignments so that not all of the grade is based on tests.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,N/A
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"If I were teaching the course, I would provide more examples to work with and less wikipedia links for explanations."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,i think including more detailed example would help
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Make video lectures shorter and more straightforward.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would have made attendance mandatory
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would focus less on the easier concepts and spend more time on the difficult concepts and explain them more.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Do a Take Home Exam online.

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,less online tests
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would have given the students more time in learning ""simulations"", I thought it was a little rushed."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would teach in a more concrete way, if that makes sense. For example, in my prerequisite statistics class, the professor clearly
wrote out the exact sequence of steps needed to accomplish each type of problem. It really helped eliminate the abstractness I
associate with math."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Smaller classes next time.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,N/A
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would have a projector to show work when teaching the class. In a large lecture hall, it is hard to see on the whiteboard even if all
the students move up due to the harsh lights and bad markers."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I wouldn’t have done recorded lectures rather live lectures because they create a personal requirement to attend also smaller class
size and require participation"
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would have students learn more conceptual ideas and then do practice problems.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Maybe some assignments to go along with OT just to check up on topics and prep for tests
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,not have each example in class be as drawn out in excessive information
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,give practice exams

learning."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would increase recitation time, since TAs have the opportunity to go into more detail. The class time is too short and the professor
sometimes had to rush"
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would have given different problems for recitation other than the problems in class. Since recitation covers the same problems, it
felt redundant to go to class"
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would allow laptops

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,nothing
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,"I would change the way office hours are instructed. I think the TAs should equally focus on completing computations by hand and
with excel. It is difficult to follow along with excel, especially with online classes."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Make some of the lessons shorter since the information is repeated from previous lessons.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would try and provide more practice problems for the students to do themselves.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,I would perhaps decrease the level of difficulty of the exams.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,change,Organize more assignments.

rushing any material. My regret is that I did not participate more."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,growth,He was supportive of many students' challenges with the material.
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,growth,"He was good overall, with no comments to improve. Maybe spend each class trying to go over more than one problem because it
started getting tense towards the online quizzes as we would have to rely on the slides to learn the information not taught in class."

rather efficient and organized manner compared to some of my other classes."
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,growth,"told us day 1 that he wants us to learn over anything else and each lecture you could tell that he wanted to move at a pace that
ensured that students understood. Also posted pages and pages of extra material we could read that wasnt required of us but was
there to learn more or learn in a different way"
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,growth,"By being flexible with the online tests and now the lectures, it has allowed me to finish the course at my own pace and allowed me

S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,other,N/A
S2020-largeclass,2020,Spring,other,There should be grades other than the tests and exam. Such as homework or assignments. These additional grades give some cushion

F2019-H1,2019,Fall,best,"The class teaches content that can be applied to various disciplines in the business world. As a Finance major, I enjoyed seeing
compatible concepts such as break–even and sensitivity analysis."
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,best,I liked learning how to apply optimization models to scenarios in my life.
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,best,I think it has practical applications
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,best,I liked the practice questions on slides

F2019-H1,2019,Fall,best,I like the minimal amount of homework that was assigned (technically they were online tests)
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,change,"More examples in class done all the way through, worked out examples posted on Blackboard"
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,change,I would include projects and case studies.

F2019-H1,2019,Fall,change,"Maybe make everything clear step by step on the PowerPoints. I see what he does in his examples, but to have a clearly written out
structure for different processes would be helpful."
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,change,More examples
F2019-H1,2019,Fall,change,"I would have the final not weigh as much. Since we didn't get any in class exams just online tests, I think it will be an adjustment to
do a paper and pen test considering we haven't had one all semester"

F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,Upload excel sheets before class so we can follow along on our computers.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,Too much weighted on the final
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,Focus more on how to use excel when modeling the problems
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,"Go over Excel problems SLOWLY. It is very difficult to follow along with the professor when he clicks on Excel options very fast. Excel
parts of the course got me confused."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,More grades and assignments so students learn
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,Make homework assignments so that the grades are not just from quizzes/exams.

F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,"I would give out more worksheets. I would also put the answers on your Powerpoint so that students can look back on notes and

F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,I would assign homework

better grades"
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,I would have more than just Romolo as a teacher
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,"I feel that the answers should be incorporated into the slides because it would be much easier and make more sense when you
want to reference the slides. Since the classes that do not have recitation make it much harder for the students who don't fully
understand the concepts so it would be beneficial if the answers were incorporated into the slides as well."

F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,no final

information similar to the question, and there was nothing."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,I will do the same thing as our professor
F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,I would implement another system of motivation to encourage students to attend class

F2019-21,2019,Fall,change,"Explain the lessons in a clearer way– the way he taught was super confusing and did not really help with the online tests. I had to
teach myself most of this course/ ask TAs."

F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,He has helped me learn to think outside of the box.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,He was passionate about the material
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,Provides plenty of course supplementary material and opportunities to practice modeling in and outside of class.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,"Professor Romulo went over many practice problems in class which helped me understand the material. He also allowed us to
work on four online tests with open notes and with a partner. This also encouraged student learning."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,I have gained a lot of experience working with excel for certain problems.

F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,I have had to do a lot of outside studying and preparation to prepare for exams and the final
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,he does not put too much stress and anxiety on the course so it made me more comfortable and relaxed with learning it
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,None
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,This course has not encouraged my intellectual growth.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,Professor encourages us learned many excel real work condition questions
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,"He gives suggestions on what may appear on homework and the Final, as well as goes over any questions the students had on
homework."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,It's helped me become quite wholistic in my approach to school.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,Always open to questions and making sure the students understand something before moving on.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,The lectures were interesting and engaging.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,"Outline which textbook chapters line up with the lectures, include midterms"
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,He was not an effective teacher. His lessons were confusing and I found it easier to teach myself the materials.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,growth,More problem practice would have been beneficial for learning the methods

F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,"Extremely intelligent professor that knows what he is doing, great work !"
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,"Please curve on the final. I have a feeling it is going to be difficult, especially because it is not open notes."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,"please be on time to class!! it's unfair that most of the class (who came to class) came at 8:40am but a lot of the times, the
professor was consistently 10–15 minutes late."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,Very helpful professor and wants to teach.
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,more online tests
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,"I think it's weird that some sections have a recitation while others do not. I found that my friends that had a recitation ended up
understanding the material better and learned more. I think it should be standard across all sections."
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,N/A
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,mandatory homework would help me stay on top of the topics more

F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,Great class ! Recommended !
F2019-21,2019,Fall,other,"none of the material learned in class was on the online tests, we do basic math in class and then are expected to know so much more at home that he doesn’t even teach us i had to watch lectures on youtube to understand and answer questions"

F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,the prof is great
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,I enjoyed the examples of business problems we would apply the theory to.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,"I like how there are 4 online exams. I think in person exams are extremely dumb because you have access to everything in the real
world and in person exams just tests who has the best memory. Wish more professors would realize how society has changed
with technology."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,the online quizzes
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,I learned useful information.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,It is applicable to a lot of situations in every day life
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,Online exams

F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,His attitude
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,Best learning about how to use excel to solve min max problm
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,"It's potentially applicable to real scenarios we could confront in the workplace and teaches us how to deal with these scenarios
using a familiar tool that will most likely be available to us regardless of where we are working."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,I actually am not a fan of the course material at all. With that being said I am a fan of the professor and how he taught the class.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,The way our professor was understanding and helpful along the way.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,best,Online exams

F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,Have answers to extra questions that are in the powerpoint presentations not just the excel files.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"maybe make it more problem based and less excel examples or make us do the excel ourselves in class for a better
understanding of what the question is asking"

F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,go a little slower
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,I would make the class more interactive to engage students.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"Maybe a project instead of a final. Personally, projects help me apply what we learned in the course to the real world and it makes
everything a lot easier to understand."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,show answers to online quizzes so kids can practice
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"Include some more videos or material outside of the powerpoint slides, that can get students thinking more actively about the
subject"
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"give homework to help practice outside of 4 online homeworks. When you get something wrong on online tests, show the math to
help understand what we are doing wrong. right now it just says right or wrong. No help with what you don't understand."

F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,Provide an itinerary of topics at the beginning of every class. Try to keep class interested.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,no idea
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"Assign some of the problems in the slides as homework that weighs into the final grade. The material that is being learned is
difficult and sometimes, students need an extra push to do well."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,"I have trouble paying attention in quite a few of my business core classes and I've found that a level of ""forced"" engagement is
helpful. In my current financial management class, we have about 5 quiz questions per class that measure both attendance and
knowledge of the material. For not answering, we receive 0 points, answering wrong would get us 1 point, and answering correctly
would get us 2 points. Since there are so many questions, a few incorrect barely affects my grade but each time we'll work through
the problems together and there's an incentive to come to class and pay attention because we're getting points as we go. Although
this probably takes a little more effort on the instructor's part, I've found that consistent checks and incentives have forced me to pay
attention, and by paying attention, I have better command of the material and don't mentally ""check–out"" in class as much."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,N/A
F2019-20,2019,Fall,change,give more examples and change the grading system to include more homework and not just rely on a final and four quizzes.

F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,He's encouraged me to learn how to apply software like Excel to business problems.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,he seems very excited about the material
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,he waits for us to answer rather than just assume we know the answers
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,"Describing the problems in real–world terms, and making it clear what the functions and constraints are actually
affecting/determining in a real–world situation"
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,A lot of time spent in classes is going over and practicing material. He is always open for office hours and will respond.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,"Very difficult to stay on top of the work when there are only 4 online quizzes and one final. I fear it is hard to get an idea of how I’m
doing before it is too late because the final is the only in–class assignment."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,"His explanations of the concepts were clear and the set of examples we were given really helped me understand the process. The
excel files were very helpful as well."

focused and engaged in his class."
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,He has gone through the course material in great detail and had broken it down well enough for better understanding.
F2019-20,2019,Fall,growth,Nine
F2019-20,2019,Fall,other,"Be more clear when correcting mistakes made. Sometimes when the professor made a mistake in a concept it was hard for me as
a student to understand what the mistake was and what was done to fix it.
The online tests are weighted too heavily. I would prefer to have midterms and the online assignments before exams to have more
practice and have them count for less."

F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,That we have four online tests to do and gives us a great chance to earn a successful grade in the class. Also having recitations to help us with the class overall and have TAS there to assist us with the class problems.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,Online test
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,I liked working with excel. This is because I can take these skills outside of the classroom and apply it to my future career.

F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,The mathematics
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,The types of problems we tackle with variables of data and constraints. Using excel and software packages that will be applicable to jobs in the real world.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,"The recitation really helps out, should be included for all sections"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,Learning some new functions of excel
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,flexibility
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,the recitations because I felt comfortable learning and asking questions
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,Not to difficult to learn
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,I like the ability for us to be able to do practice problems and work together to study the material.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,I like that I learned how to use excel
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,The TAs
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,The instructor and TAs did a good job of teaching the material and reiterating important takeaways.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,All of the above.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,The recitations and the lectures cover different content and help in different ways.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,Recitations are really helpful
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,That it wes quantitative
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,best,I liked the excitement that the instructor had in addition to the way material was explained.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Go back to the original grading model
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,More practice problems
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would assign homework so that students are able to practice more
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Less non of the above
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Upload more video in case of someone missing class by accident
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would post the lectures earlier so people can follow along and post the solved versions of the problems done in class so students can check their work. Not being able to check over work makes it extremely difficult to learn because we never really know if we are doing the problems correctly.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Decrease the amount of extra content distributed.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I think preparing for the final has been difficult because the prior examinations have been a different format. So I would alter that so students have something to base their studying off of.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Just have smaller sections, no recitation sections"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Be more clear, thoroughly lay out how to solve problems on slides and notes"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Optional Final

F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,N/A
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would give credit for recitation attendance
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would not do anything differently.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Add homework possibly
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,None
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I would keep recitations the same and instruct TAs to solve key examples from classes and take time to review lecture and answer questions. They are the only reason anyone in this class performs well. However, I would completely change the lecture presentations. They provide no help whatsoever. I once missed lecture, and the presentation slides were completely useless. They explain questions in a meaningless manner. They provide no detailed solutions to questions, and no extra notes to help learn the material."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Be more engaging
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Focus more on understanding during lecture and concept mastering
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"less excel and if you're going to do so, then make the final exam on the computer"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,do more straightforward
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Incorporate midterms
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,More examples.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I think this form is great
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Smaller class size, better organization"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,At least have one midterm so students get an idea of how the final would look like since the final is so heavily weighted.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,more online resources
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I would start the excel programs from the beginning, because it's hard to follow along without access to the excel template"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would try and teach more closely to exam material. A lot of material is done on excel and we do not use excel for the final exam.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"More real–world examples, applications. I don't think the role of operations was explained very well. We just plugged numbers into excel and formulas. I will forget nearly everything I did in the course."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would not give a final exam. I would give more online exams.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would try to not have all the online exams be heavily based on excel when the final exam has to be done without it.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,make students use excel
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I may add a midterm exam.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,simply some of the material
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would allow for an eighty minute lecture time
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Less time spent on things that aren't very important to the course.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Slides are needed before class not a week after the teaching is done. Excel needs more in class practice it’s somenthing we will use in the real world. Longer class time. 3credits is 3hours a week. No idea how RUBS came up short changing students for what we are paying. The 3 hours a week are specially necessary for this type of course were you need time to practice in class.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"it seems difficult using the writing pad, so i dont think i would use"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Encourage more student engagement
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would assign more Homework for credit which would prepare students more for both the Online Tests and the Final. This would also give students a chance to improve their overall grade through hard work.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would write step by step notes for certain problems.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Do not turn off the lights for lecture and use clickers for clicker questions
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Smaller classes
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,make the grading scale a bit different
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Do assign hw having practice problems in it .
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would have more detailed stereo by step instruction for using excel
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Have smaller lectures for more interaction
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Make online tests easier and more excel based
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I will change the percentage of the online quiz, an online quiz is 60% of the total class, it's too heavy. I think I will provide some chapter homework to let students practice more instead of 4 online quizzes."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Maybe smaller class sizes so there is more of a one on one feel when someone needs help
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Upload class presentations on time, properly go over the probs, set up an efficient and effective system to discuss probs and their solutions in class."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Assign more practice problems
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Change the entire structure of the course and make the final online or instead of a final make it a complex group problem that needs to be solved on excel
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,small classes
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,/
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would have practice quizzes in class
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Have the TAs teach and not the professor
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Homework other than online tests
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Put less weight on final
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"More homework, slower pace"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Have more homework
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would probably have weekly assignments to keep up with course material.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would explain Excel process better
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Have more office hours
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Everything. With no exceptions!!!
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I don't feel like it should be apart of the business core curriculum, I don't see it applying such in the real business world"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Make Presentation decks clearer and concise.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Should not have such a large lecture class
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would weight the in longline assignments more heavily and put less weight on the final exam.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,more homework
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I might differentiate more clearly between material being further conceptual and actually on tests
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I would have more practice problems for each chapter, and organize study better."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,better recitation
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Make the lecture a smaller section people in the back dont know what he is talking about and cant engage
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,more powerpoint slides
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,change the final test to online as well
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Put answers to examples on powerpoint slides
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,i would give more time to each concept
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Give extra credit to those that attend lecture and get more people involved in lecture so that they understand how to solve the problems and not struggle on the final exam. With the extra credit, boost up anyone's grade that is low in the class."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Make the final exam to not be 40% instead 20% and have attendance as the 20%
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would give students more resources to understand Excel on a higher level.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,do the same things
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Change grading criteria
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I think much of the learning was done during recitation, yet all recitation classes differed from one another. Class time flew by rather quickly, resulting in few problems being completed during class. Also, the class size was so large, but this type of material takes a lot of time and attention to truly grasp."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would not have 4 online exams. It does not adequately prepare the students for the final that is worth 40% of their grade.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,interactive
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would provide more examples and hands–on activities that apply the information learned in class
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Honestly I don't know how to make this class interesting. That's the only thing that's wrong with it and the professor at least made things easier for us so I guess he knows what he's doing.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Explain topics more simpler
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Make the Final an online exam as well
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Mandatory attendance
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Make the class more interesting, barely anyone goes to class"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,More exams instead of a heavily weighted final
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would create a greater incentive for students to come to class.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,more in class activities
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,nothing
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would try to move a little bit slower and write clearer.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"I would make the class more enjoyable, some days I'd come in and not even know what was going on. In big lectures, it's hard to stay focused. Having some interaction, maybe even dedicating a class to group work so ppl can try problems together would be more beneficial for students. The purpose is for everyone to understand the material, there has to be a more efficient way."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would not make the final 40% of the whole grade.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Maybe make more hands on learning
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,make the class more interesting by adding student engagement tools like clicker or few homework assignments for grade boosting
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Teach concepts over problems.
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,send out a study guide

F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Personally think the grading is fine, but definitely allow people to go back during the online tests. It was very frustrating not being able to go back, especially when sometimes connections bad, and your answer may not have gone through, but you cannot go back to check"

F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,I would spend a little more time on examples
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,"Release all of the course material at the beginning of the semester, too many times you went over something and we didn't have access to the material. You got lazier as the semester went on, the slides lacked material for us to actually learn the material, it is just filled w examples. Assign less computational excel stuff if it won't be on the final"
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,Have exams
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,change,It's hard to say with the material not being of interest to me. Probably include more homework in place of the 4 online tests that have you walk through entire problems.

The whole class was facilitated very poorly. Students have no clue what is going on in class and what is required of them. I am a very diligent student who always attends class and recitation and I feel like this class is such a waste of time and redundant. RBS can require students to take a different class that will actually have some added value."
F2019-largeclass,2019,Fall,growth,I have learned a lot in this class and I can contribute that to professor Elys ability to teach.

Another thing I liked about Romulo Nerves Ely is that he will help out if you're struggling hard with a problem and show easy ways to solve it with a clear understanding.

S2019-22,2019,Spring,change,I did not like how students were generalized. Students cannot control other students and therefore should be treated as individuals not as a whole.
S2019-22,2019,Spring,change,I would give students more opportunities to get points rather than having three exams and five homeworks. One of which is dropped. I feel as though if you had one bad test it can almost cause you to fail for the semester.

It takes some time for me to process. However, once I lose track for one subset of what the professor is talking about, I won't be able to understand the solution as an entity, especially for the questions needed to solve by excel. Sometimes, I didn't see what the professor put in. Then I am totally lost after he clicks the ""solve"" button."
S2019-22,2019,Spring,change,"For the extra–credit / attendance initiative, I would start by giving everyone in the class an extra 3–5% in extra credit. Attendance would be taken during random class periods. Students who did not attend would lose one of the extra credit points. This could be modified for certain cases, such as when a student who always comes to class accidentally misses one of the classes in which attendance is taken. But overall this system is a good way of getting students to attend more classes."

Checked one day that homework was due on a Monday night 11:59 p.m. I checked later to see the due date was changed and was due 8am the morning of without the professor making any kind of announcement about the due date changed. Not acceptable for a homework that has a significant amount of weight on the final grade.
S2019-22,2019,Spring,other,"I would give students more of an opportunity to get points through the course of the semester through online quizzes, attendance, I feel students who show up everyday for class on time should be rewarded for doing so because it shows that they care for the class"

S2019-22,2019,Spring,other,"Also, sample questions for the exam will be really helpful. I really hope the professor could provide it as a practice tool for the exam.
And the other issue is office hour, the conflict schedule happens to me. However, I would be able to reach the professor through email to make an appointment because he teaches too many students."
S2019-22,2019,Spring,other,Great professor for this course
S2019-22,2019,Spring,other,good class
S2019-22,2019,Spring,other,Interesting material overall.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Like it!
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Lots of material to learn
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,The scenarios were based in real world fact.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,I like how we had take home tests because it taught me to work under pressure in this class
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,nothing
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,I liked how the professor was extremely good at knowing what students were asking and helping them in the most effective way.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,professor truly cares
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,It had rly hard exams.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,The Solver function is very interesting and powerful.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,The pace of the class was good. Not too fast or slow
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Takes baby steps learning new hard subjects
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,I enjoyed learning how to use excel to solve linear programming models.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,The professor's straighforwardness and positive attitude.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,The emphasis on excel
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Solving problems. Everything was very practical
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Useful skill using excel to solve problems
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,I like that he follows the lecture slides and walks us through the problems
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Constraints are fun.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,He explains all the questions very well and addresses all confusion and issues students may hve.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Use of Excel
S2019-21,2019,Spring,best,Professor Romeo was extremely engaging for an 8:40 am class and was constantly challenged with tired students. I give the man lot of credit for showing the energy and enthusiasm that early in the morning. He loves what he teaches.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Would have provided students with a sample hw or qs showing how the questions would possibly be structured on the exam
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"Not require attendance since we can just learn everything at outside of class.
Also please drop the lowest homework grade no if buts or so, just do it.
He said he was going to drop the lowest homework grade if 80% of the class showed up. No one is going to do that for a 8:40 am
class which most people oversleep anyway. Why should my grade be affected by people who don't put any work into this class? If I attend class I shouldn't be penalized just because others don't show up. Ridiculous!"
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,I would be more organized in my teaching style. I would present the material in class that would be similar to exams and homework. I would give midterms during midterms and not a week before the final exam.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"better examples, more hw problems not timed"
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"If I was teaching this course, I would balance it more between concepts and practice problems. Most of this course seemed to be heavily weighted towards practice problems."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,encourage more student participation
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"The way the homework assignments are assigned makes it very difficult. I would have done much better on the homework
assignments if they were issued in a better way. We should have until the deadline with no time limit (7 hours). This 7 hour time
limit (which counts time even if you aren't in the assignment) makes completing homework stressful because I know that I will need
to allow enough time in order to finish the whole thing at once. Whereas if there was no time constraint, I would be able to work on
the problems throughout the course of the week and most likely finish much before the deadline. I also do not like that you can't skip around the homework questions. Most people like to save the hardest questions for last, but with this style, you can't do that which also adds unnecessary stress. And lastly, it would be a MILLION times more helpful if the homework showed not only the correct answer, but the worked out steps in order to get to the right answer. Other than the way the homework is formatted, I would also designate time in class for students to work on a practice problem and then go over the solution on the board."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"I would have more Step by step slides with direct instruction of what I am looking for in an answer, and helpful videos, make time for a study session for students having diffcult time with the subjects."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Make it more stuctured. and make sure the students are aculoly learning. Do not offer it without a recitation.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Give less lectures about how to solve problems using excel because it will not be on the exam.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Make it a little more clear about what to focus in on for exams
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"focus more on the material that we will be tested on and less on stuff that we will not, ei excel. While it is beneficial to have an understanding of how excel works, an entire class period should not be spent on it since it will not help when it comes to the test"
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Provide written instructions on how to use excel for each problem. I would forget how to do something and had great difficulty relearning it on my own.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Drop lowest hw grade
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"I would not put any trick questions on tests. Lots of the questions on the exams seemed like they were there just to try to trip you up
even though you know the material. It was very frustrating when lots of the answers to the exam questions were none of the above. e. All the above are true"
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Explanation of how we are being tested clearer.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"Not sure, it's a required course that I did not have interest in."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,"Ease a bit more into the excel material, it went from easy to follow to a bit difficult."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,I would assign hw on something other than blackboard. Something about it seems sketchy. I’d like to also be graded on excel stuff.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,If I were teaching the course I would clearly state to my students what knowledge is needed to score well on the exams. Something that I have been having trouble within this course is knowing whether or not I'm going to need to know how to use excel to solve problems.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,I wouldn't focus as much on the excel if it isn't going to be on the exam
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Have students actually use Excel in class while demonstrating how to solve the sample problems.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,Slides released in class
S2019-21,2019,Spring,change,I would change the format of the exam as copying down questions to scrap paper takes time and increases the chances of minor mistakes which could be avoided.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,I developed an interest in the course!
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,He didn't. He was disorganized and presented material poorly. He expected more than was taught in class on the homework and exams.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,na
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,The instructor urged students to take initiative on their own to ask questions in class and think practically to solve problems.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,He encouraged us to use excel even when we didn't want to for more practice and he answered any questions in class and was very helpful.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,He did well trying to build interest. He gave us a lot of resources in the real world and was generally intrested in making us learn excel.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,Try new things...take baby steps
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,n/a
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,"He is incredibly friendly and up beat, but I did not feel particularly engaged."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,Helped me understand how to use excel to solve business problems. I’m disappointed we weren’t graded on using excel because it was an extremely important part of the class.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,Needs to release slides before lectures hard to follow when slides are not available.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,growth,Really promotes the use of Excel which is crucial to know in the business world.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,The course covers very basic concepts and it felt like the information was being dragged out so that it would fit the semester time period. I feel like it should not have taken more than 1 – 1.5 months to cover all the material. I feel that a majority of my time with this course was wasted because of this.
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,See Above
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,"Actually teach the proper material. And actually teach new material between midterm and final. To give a midterm on May 2 and the final on May 14, teaching no new material in between is unfair."
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,N/A
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,okay class
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,"I didnt like that there were so many trick questions on the exams. Lots of the questions on the exams seemed like they were there
just to try to trip you up even though you know the material. It was very frustrating when lots of the answers to the exam questions
were none of the above. a. Redundant complaint (constraint?)"
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,Maybe allow us to use our laptops for exams to actually use excel
S2019-21,2019,Spring,other,look at top.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,I like the fact that I have learned something I have never been exposed to before.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,It pushes me
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,there were many examples of how to apply the information
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,"Ely made the class fun, and he was a good professor."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,It uses excel in a way that I never used before
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,The real business world examples
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,I can tell that the material is interesting.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,The homework’s counting for exam grade and how much they help to study
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,How well this class relates to business and has real–world implications.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,Very clear grading and course material; I knew exactly what was needed to do well. The material also is very gradual and thus easy at the start and slowly increased i difficulty.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,Nothing.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,The material
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,"The actual use of excel in the course. Most of the courses I have taken here are purely theory with no actual practicality. Actually modeling problems and doing simulations, while basic in their nature, is miles ahead of most of the courses I have taken."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,i liked learning about how to solve the problems.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,His attitude toward students makes me feel that I am respected.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,The professor
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,I liked the usage of excel the most.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,"I like that the problems worked in class are directly from the book because you get the explanation twice, allowing for better understanding."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,Nothing
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,"I like that the material is truly useful and can be used for a variety of projects one would deal with in everyday life, especially knowing how to execute maximization and minimization problems."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,"I liked the recitation, I feel as though that was the most helpful."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,It was easy to see the real–life applications.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,best,I enjoyed learning the material.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would take the material a bit slower for classes who do not have recitation sections. It seems that the classes with recitation instructors had a clearer understanding of the material.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"Make the material not as difficult, most students have a hard time with it. this may be out of the teachers hands"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"Homework is very different to what is taught on class Second midterm is on the last day of classes, one week before the final even though there is no new material Prof discouraged students from emailing questions but rarely replies to forums A lot of errors in the homework answers and design"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,Would teach us more of how to simplify solving a problem versus teaching why and how it is done in the most technical way. I was in a section with no TA and was fortunate to go to a TAs review session and she simplified how to do everything that I wish we were learning in class.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"Homeworks were quite difficult, and hold substantial weight in the final grade. I would make the homework easier, or at least better reflect what was on the exams. For example we don't use excel on exams so take those out of the HW."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would upload the slides before class and add how the problems are solved
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,Not use excel as much
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"I don't think homework should be used for testing purposes. I am a firm believer that homework should exist to reinforce concepts
taught in class, and too many times new concepts were introduced on homework assignments that we had no exposure to, and my
grade suffered because of it."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"written homework to hand in, hand grade, and hand back so students can see what they're doing wrong"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would have more example problems
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would put more of a focus on excel
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"I think the course needs to be more difficult. We touch upon the very basics of operations management and many of the topics are covered in other courses like optimization and confidence intervals (Statistics, Calculus). I feel that the course should be project–based to give student a better feel for actually doing the model or simulation construction."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,Actually teach. Also eliminate the three hour lecture. Everyone I know said they only learned in recitation anyway
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would not have the homework assignments be set up in a format where I can't change the answers after I enter them in.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,Study guides
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,Not sure here.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,nothing
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would have a bit more structure in the class. I think dates need to be finalized further in advanced and the homework and exams should be more similar in nature.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"Try to find ways to make material more interesting. I know there is only but so much you can do to make solving problems interesting, but it was difficult to keep engaged a full lecture."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"Include a project in our grades. I realize the amount of students that take this course makes this difficult, but I think we need more professors teaching this so we can better learn how this material can be applied."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would maybe ask students if they would like to solve a problem or part of a problem on the board.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"I would be more accommodating to the students, provide better communication, and assist students effectively."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,I would solve more problems on the board rather than on excel. Solving things by hand would make homework and exams a lot easier.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,change,"I would make the exam more open–ended so partial credit could also be given. I feel that the homework could have also been graded on both completion and on correctness so that if the student got maybe 80% or above correct, then the student would receive the full credit."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,I am interested in learning more about Operations Management
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,He wanted us to come to class. Its a hard subject and it gets hard to pay attention in a 3 hour class.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,He has given us additional opportunities to challenge ourselves beyond the material we learn in class
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,Gave a peek into the future business world
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,"I feel like the powerpoints should be more descriptive, like give step by step instructions for problems and truly teach how to use excel more because even though the course is important, I've always been told about how important excel is and I believe that has a huge impact of helping people in the real world"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,"Helped expand my interest in operations studies; hope to take addition courses post–grad which can help me build on this knowledge, particularly with financial modeling."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,"This is the first mandatory business math class I didn't enjoy, and I'm a marketing major so its a shock i liked any other them. But this one made me feel like i was losing knowledge."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,Not at all. He is very disorganized and does not help to answer students questions.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,His homework difficulty helps to encourage us to study harder.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,I believe the class needs to follow a structure where you either adapt homework and exams to include the usage of excel. I do not feel as though only using excel for homework is beneficial when the exams do not include the usage of excel.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,Professor Romulo was always stressing the importance of practice which I realized helps me significantly to do.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,"Professor Ely was slightly unorganized when teaching the class. I also feel as though he did not effectively answer my questions. I also think it is extremely unfair to give a Midterm 1 week before the Final. This is extremely hectic for students who have 4 to 5 exams. Overall, I did not think the class was organized well and the material could have been taught better."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,He's very engaged and trusting of his students. He's always incredibly confident in us and does a lot to make sure that everyone is okay.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,growth,Would answer questions when we were confused.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"Overall, the professor is good and truly cares about the students. Not too many complaints."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,Its hard stuff
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"Professor is boring and does not give any simple methods to understand, he is uncommunicative"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,Less homework surrounding excel. If we can't use excel on the exam then why are we required to do it in the homework? I felt like he showed us how to do a lot of things using excel but didn't show us how to solve without excel which is what we need to know how to do on the exam.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"For the attendance, I would try to find a way to do it by person, I know other large classes have achieved this result."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"I think Professor Ely needs help. He's stretched too thin and is running ragged, and can't devote the necessary time to answer all student concerns. Either the course needs fewer sections or more professors."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,N/A
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,Really good and nice professor. Very accomodating to students and explains the material slowly and clearly!
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,Eliminate the course since it was useless.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"In my point of view, the operation management is a subject that must be boring to most of the students because it is formed in that way. However, his effort makes students concentrate on the class when they come for class although the attendance rate is not that high"
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,n/a
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"A student's academic life from the beginning is geared towards learning material in order to pass exams. While it's useful to learn beyond what is on the exam, for some students it is extremely difficult when they don't have all the time to solely focus on school. If we are going to explore excel, like in the second half of the course I'd say consider making it a part of exams, as it is valuable. Maybe consider a portion of the exam or all the exam taken online so it could be included."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"I think I overall fundamentally disagree with this course being mandatory for all business majors since we most likely would not be using this content in our full time careers. I think its helpful to learn this type of math, but I also think everything we've learned here has been also covered in other classes in the business core. Because none of the information in this class was really ""new"" I felt like the exams were testing if you understood different verbiage regarding the same problem. Overall this class did not add much value to my education."
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,The three hour section should be removed and should just be taught twice a week with recitation. I think this will maximize student learning more instead of meeting only once a week and trying to grasp all the information in that time.
S2019-20,2019,Spring,other,"Excel was interesting and helped a lot with checking answers; however, I found myself not knowing how to solve certain problems by hand because we breezed through it in class to get to excel."

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,"I enjoyed the formulation of problems in this course. I enjoyed the way the professor taught the problems especially in the beginning of the course–using different colors while drawing the graphs, explaining a step by step approach."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,The applicability to real life business situations
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,Recitation is very helpful

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,"I liked the fact that the big sessions had recitations. It was extremely hard to learn the material in a lecture setting, but the smaller class recitations helped. I also liked the drawings on the electric board."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,"real–life examples, business examples, recitation was very helpful"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,Having recitation every week is important for staying current for the material.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I like that there is recitation to helps recap that has been taught in class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,He is terrible instructor he is the worst and needs to either be fired or quit.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,The mathematical aspect to it
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked the concepts we learned in this course.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,the TA Shaye was amazing.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,"Homework had flexible dates, exam reviews and recitation classes were very helpful"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,The exams were exactly what he said was going to be on the exam
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,The coursework throughout the course was fairly easy and understandable. I was never crammed with work for this class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked that the homework was worth a many points that would be an incentive to go into depth with the material and learn it more efficiently
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,the goodness of it

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,It’s a rather straightforward class due to the fact a lot of the math principles were things I learned prior.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked how the course made me logically think to find solutions of the problem. this course provided a lot of practical knowledge about how to apply these techniques in real business problems to find solutions.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked that this course was used in realistic matters. It showed how this course is effective in the real world unlike some other courses I've taken.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,The content

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked that Attendance was optional.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I liked the material
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,He had prepared a lot of examples to go over
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I enjoyed having to use excel to model the same programs we did in class by hand. This really helped me understand the problems from a different/real world point of view and see how much we can really accomplish with technology.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I like that the course encourages problem solving and trial–and–error practices.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,I love math so it is interesting
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,Concepts are interesting
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,best,nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Definitely teach things that were more relevant to the exams and be more organized.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"grade more fairly, not make the exams totally off from the hw,"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I wouldn't do anything differently.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,more homeworks
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Have better communication with TAs
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make lectures more concise
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the class session longer than 55 minutes. I would also give a shorter exam since we have less time to solve it. I would allow students to write on the exam paper. I would probably not include “none of the above” in every single exam question because it makes everything 100x harder.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the exams more fair
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the course more coherent and spend more time actually teaching the topics instead of haphazardly doing problems that ultimately do not help students as no one really understands what is going on.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would take the class and break it down. Also allow students to cycle between homework questions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would change this course in almost every facet:
First – this should not be taught in a large lecture hall, and if it is, it should be taught by a different professor than Romulo Ely. He is
not an adequate professor and does not strive to aid students when they are struggling. Second – there were way too many ambiguities throughout this course which caused many students to be unsure about the class and the material
Lastly, to change the structure of a class is okay, however to do it without testing it out beforehand shows this professors lack of ability to teach a course. The exams were made way too difficult, the homework were too difficult and this all caused the recitation teachers to be lost when trying to teach us the material."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,More clear slides
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Let students write in the exams. Be more engaging while teaching.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Add recitations to all sections as students do not learn much during lecture.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"The thing I would do differently was maybe do not assume that students know excel that well. I do not have a computer with excel so for me the concept of excel with these problems was difficult to understand without quite a bit of explanation. The slides went through excel well, however I found it very difficult to understand once we got to simulations."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Maybe have smaller sections so there is more time to answer student's questions?
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Possibly have a full time class instead of 55 minutes
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,i would go through more examples during class
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Teach what we would be tested on rather than spending weeks on Excel that we don't even need to know.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Definitely make the test easy make the problems similar to homework since most students understood the concept, and that will be more important to me to know that my students have understood the concept and are willing to do better."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Allow students to see exams
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,The class was extraordinarily confusing as to what was on the tests and the questions on the test due to the amount of variations he made. There was a general sense of confusion even among the TA's as to the content on the exams and even the grading of the homework.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make the lectures a bit clearer and give more in–depth explanations of example problems because that is all we have as students to really learn the material. I would also make sure the TAs were synchronized because they are all teaching different things which is unfair to some sections over others.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,the attendance policy in regards to dropping hw.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,more mandatory attendence
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Have a professor who speaks better English and has slides that does not just copy off the textbook.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Slides were not effective at all when it came to studying before tests.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would introduce the material by briefly starting off with a real world problem that affects the students. That would get students interested and then continue off of that on how that connects to the certain material we were learning that day.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would: 1.) Make sure ALL TAs know what will be on the exams so when they review, they know what to review. I have been told multiple times by multiple TAs that ""Professor isn't telling us what exactly will be on the exam"" 2.) Test all students FAIRLY. I was told by the professor that different exams had different numbers and problems to discourage cheating, but if different students are given different problems on the same exam, it is not fair. 3.) Tell students what sections to study WELL BEFORE the exam date. We have a mid–term tomorrow, May 1st, and the professor sent out an email less than an hour ago clearing up what sections will be on the exam. 1 day is not enough. 4.) Do not have the last midterm in the 15th WEEK of the semester and have no new material between the last midterm and the Final. If that is the case, then just have the Final Exam."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Everything, I would actually teach all the material on the exams and make my slides accurate"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Less technical explanation and more content
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would take responsibility as a professor and recognize the mistakes that I have done. Misgrading exams and having incorrect answer keys should result in a curve rather than a correction because of the delay in the correction. It was only after the withdrawal period was up, that you corrected the exams again. A lot of people had no idea that their grade would go down and couldn't drop the class any more. THIS WAS A HORRIBLE MISCONDUCT. GET THE RIGHT ANSWERS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INCORRECT ONES."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,format the slides better and make sure TA's are consistent across all recitation
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,No excel portion during lecture
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would have smaller rooms to teach this class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the homework's a little easier with less weight to your grade.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would make attendance a graded requirement so that there would be a reason for more students to come to class and hence make it easier for them to be exposed to the material. I would also suggest doing some projects or other assignments as well that are graded. On homework, I would get rid of the 7 hour time limit because it is stressful and does not encourage learning. I do not have the time to seek out help on problems I do not understand with the time limit"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,make it gooder
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would focus less on Excel during class because that is why most students lost interest. We also do not use excel on the exams so to many students it seems kind of pointless. Instead, focus more on picking up the pen and creating models."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,GIve credit to the kids that went to class
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Review more multiple choice material in class. Class did not always prepare me for the exam.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would add more assignments which help students understand course concepts
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"More examples in class, less hand–holding. Please use the actaul whiteboard, the digital whiteboard is cumbersome, time–consuming, and we only get to see it for a short amount of time. I f people really care about the lesson, they will move up to read the board."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would assign online homework due monday, review in class monday, then discuss new topic wednesday"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Not put so much ""None of the Above"" as an answer choice, it really messed people up a lot."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Possibly make it 120 minutes so the instructor has more time to go over generalized material (terms/theory/etc)
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the homeworks not weigh as much. Maybe a little project could replace some of the weight.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,No excel
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,explain the convoluted sections as simple as possible
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make it more interactive/pertaining to the business world. Right now it feels like an applied algebra class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,more homework
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"When working out the examples, make it seem more organized"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,More exam review sessions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Maybe outline the topics a bit more? Also, clearly define what information students need to focus on for th exam"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would be more clear and fair about examinations.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,–
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Not have everything done in excel.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Check more attendance or do not check attendance
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Possibly just go a little slower in class
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would make attendance an individual grade, not a class wide grade. I would the attendance of each student individually and reward those who show up instead of taking attendance as a percentage of the class."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would project my voice a bit better, and would hold smaller classes"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I might add more exercises to make students prepare well for the exams
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Meet with the TA's more often. I went to a few different ones and they were never on the same page or teaching the same things.
Also the class needs to be 100 times more organized with keeping students up to date on what is going on and uploading the powerpoints more quickly. Throughout the semester I was just confused and frustrated. I wish there was even more help I could find– such as 1 on 1 tutoring."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Encourage more students to go to class – make class participation a portion of a grade (i.e. taking attendance, clicker questions, saying this in class that will only benefit those who attend on quizzes/exams, etc.)."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"The class was taught very slowly. We didn't need to take 7 weeks to go over the first three lectures (linear programming). After a while, it was very redundant and boring. The concepts could have been taught quicker."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make the exams more fair.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"split the larger class into smaller ones, super hard to pay attention and ask questions with so many people"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,My advice is to organize and engage the class more so that the teaching can be more effective
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would give more time on exams and give partial credit on exams since many problems involved math, which take longer to solve and involve several steps."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Provide better examples with more explanation
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,HELP THEM HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT USING EXCEL
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Not ask homework questions that you need excel for, since it is not used on exams."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would focus less on excel. While it is important to utilize this application in the business world, it is difficult to teach formulas and formatting in excel in a large lecture hall. Not only was all of the excel difficult to understand in class, but numerous problems were also only able to be solved in excel and not by hand like the tests focused on."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing. Maybe taking attendance every time instead of random times.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,k
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make it more interesting for the students.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Better study guides
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Present the material in a more organized manner and make it easier to understand and more clear.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,test more on core material
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"More interactive, exams having more questions..."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"The lectures are very confusing and looking back on all of the lectures the explanations were hard to follow and made little sense. The exams were also clearly trying to be difficult and trip students up. I studied for days leading up to the exam and could do all problems from homework and lecture, as well as knew all the concepts and still found the exam to be extremely difficult."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Use less pictures of the graphs and charts in the slides
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,The whole course
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would encourage attendance better
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,More organized ppt

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would make the material easier to understand, some of the solutions are a bit confusing."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would give the exams to smaller sections individually. Also, make either class or recitation mandatory."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would do more example problems in class. I would take time to review more in depth of the homework and not just fly by questions.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,More frequent homework but with less material
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,If I was teaching this course I would provide more assignments that would help understand material.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Separate lectures into days as Day A for just lecture and understanding and Day B for excel tutorials. The combination of doing both wasted much time in class and reduced interest immensely. A separation of days would encourage learning and greater student attendance.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"It was extremely disorganized. Regrades for exams and homeworks, the exam day itself was a mess with countless interruptions, and just miscommunication with a lot of things."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would give a multiple choice study guide for exams.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,everything
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would put less emphasis on the homework and maybe use a system that allows you to go back to answered questions.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would teach students the material according to how the exams will be. The homeworks would not formatted like exams. Instead, they would allow students to work together to actually understand the material. My exams would fit in the time the class is held and students would not have to fight for time. I would also make sure that the TAs in recitation are teaching the students the same thing and are in the loop with the professor."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,give easier homework
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the exams and homeworks a lot better.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"explain examples better, be more organized, only teach the relevant information"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Made sure to keep students engaged.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Assign homework problems that relate to what is going to be on the exam
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Maybe more examples to do ourselves in class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Some exams were too hard even after putting a lot of effort. So I would suggest to not make the exams too hard.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would make sure that since it is a math course, that I show all the problems on the board so that everyone would understand it and see how its done."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would stop rushing through the material. The professor doesn’t consider that the last time many of the students even remotely touched calculus was 3 years prior to taking his class. He should also do a better job with explaining the math because he skips over certain important details.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,exam content review
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,No
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Be more open with the students about what will be on the exams, rather than surprising us by adding questions on the exam that"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,we have never learned of before.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,asdfas
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would do a lot of things differently. For starters, I would actually tell students what material to study for the exam. Secondly, I would prepare them as most as I can and clear as many confusions of students rather than giviing ambiguous answers."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would remove the ""none of the above"" answer choice in the homework and exams. No matter how well I know the material, of course there will be a degree of doubt in the answer I received to a question. For that reason, the ""none of the above"" choice makes me question my work unnecessarily, and really adds no value."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Everything
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would present my lecture more clearly to help people understand them better
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make extra credit of some sort available or more opportunity aside from exam and homework grades
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Figure out an incentive to have students come to lecture more often
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,make more practice problems available
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,During class instead of using excel to solve the problem actually compute them without excel.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I wouldn't focus so much on Excel because it isn't even tested on the exam so it seems pointless to learn.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I think that the entire course is too focused on excel. There should be more things that we learn that will actually be on the exam
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Make class more interesting. It was very boring topic, but useful. I wish the professor made attendance madatory, that way I would learn excel in class."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I know not a lot of sections have recitation, but having one is a good addition."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"more fair exams and homework, it should be more material driven"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Homeworks weighted less
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,go over problems more thoroughly
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I wouldn't teach it.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"I would have posted lecture slides prior to class so students would have the information prior. Have set dates for midterms. Would not have a second midterm administered 9 days before the final exam. Keep in contact with my TA, as they were all lost to all the information being taught. The TAs were completely out of the loop of what was being taught during lectures and had been given no knowledge of what would be expected of the exams and when exams dates were."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,just be on the same pages as your tAs
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make sure the answers to your exams are correct well before making the students take it
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Be more clear in teaching Excel problems
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,N/A
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make homework different. Be more prepared.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"You should not teach this course in a large setting, the material is to complicated to have 100+ students listening to just the lecture and being unable to ask questions or have a more personalized experience."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,N/A
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make it more organized. Make the communication between TAs and students better.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"The professor did an excellent job at teaching the material. So, I have no critics about that. My professor had an attendance issue. In regards to that I would recommend to him that he makes attendance 5–10% of the final grade and take attendance every day. That way it is bound to increase."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Smaller sections.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Homework should have a shorter time limit like 2hrs and 30mins and have the option to go back to change an answer because students learn from the questions they are given and realize the mistake they made while doing it
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,d
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Release HW assignments with more notice than just 1 week before an exam. Stick to hard exam dates, write HW and Test
questions that are designed to test concepts not just be how well we can read the question and not trip up on TINY details. Also just let students write on exams, you're still wasting paper with Bluebooks and it says a lot that you're recycling the same poorly written exams every single semester."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Give two tries on the homework.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,The amazing style of the tests are good and it would be better with a sheet of formulae given.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Allow students to see what they got wrong on the exams
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"There are too few homeworks, messing up one can completely ruin your grade."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the lectures more interactive.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would not assign excel homework’s when my exams are multiple choice
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Make sure all files are uploaded that are necessary for the homeworks and make sure all the homework answer keys are correct before opening up the assignment.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,If I was teaching this class I would try and be more organized when grading assignments.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,provide actual solutions to practice problems
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Homework was completely unfair. Too many mistakes regarding the questions and only if emailed were you able to get some points back on questions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Definitely space out the exams more. Since there is no new information for the final, we will have the same material for the second midterm and the final which are 10 days apart"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Nothing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,More questions for homework
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would probably make better slides. Some of the slides do not explain what is going on very well.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Not have our second midterm the last week of class
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would use a difference homework website.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would allow the students to go back on the homework questions. I didn't like how you couldn't check your answers before submitting.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the lecture slides available ahead of time so we can prepare our notes and be ready for class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Different teaching style, sometimes it would confuse me more then help"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"If i were teaching this course, I would try to do similar types of problems in class that are on the homework assignments."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,n/a
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,The information learned in class was completely different than homework and exam material.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Different Was are better than others. I would balance that out
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"less excel, or teach how to actually use excel during recitation"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"You should not have any more large sections, only smaller ones. I took nothing away from the large class and only learned in recitation."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Give an exam review
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,nothing.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,more recitations/practice problems
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,"Everything, power points unclear, homework too hard, exam keys wrong, no communication. Only good thing is exam policy."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make homework less Excel intensive and use more concepts or hands on problems.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Go through different examples in the lecture rather than the same ones in recitation.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,more communication with TA's
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,make the course more interesting
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Do less excel work
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would make the classes smaller so its easier to get the point across instead of big lectures.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,make the slides more completed
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Step buy step solutions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,Teach multiple smaller classes instead of a big one.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I wouldn't make the attendance rule for each individual instead of the whole class. I would also find a better way to engage students during class as the big lecture hall is fairly boring and many students zone out quickly.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,If I were teaching this course I would try to avoid having such large lectures. This class seems more suitable for smaller classes where students have access to computers so they may practice with Excel.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,step by step instruction more clear instruction foster better learning environment
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,I would not make the last midterm to be so close to the final exam. I think there should be a good gap between the midterm and the last homework and the final exam.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,change,teach better
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Challenging homework.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Different levels of problem difficulty would help a lot
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,i learned a lot about operations management
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,By teaching me about new concepts
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,n/A
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He considered all students’ feedback and tried to be as helpful as possible. When he felt like he made a mistake, he took care of it and corrected it without hesitation. He has a great sense of humor too :)"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The professor attempted to both teach the theory and do examples in class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Take student feeback into consideration.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He seems like a nice person, but not a very effective or responsible professor."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,I think this course helped me understand a lot more about an area that I was not previously familiar with. The class helped me to work through word problems that I previously had a lot of trouble with.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He encouraged individuals to do projects on their own
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Not at all
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He started off really nice, Rumolo is a nice person but just not the greatest professor his teaching style was very vague. I am somebody who study a lot and attend every class, for some reason this class was extra hard I am not saying this because I lack the motivation from my end , but I also asked other students they had a similar opinion. I really hope he reads this, and try something more helpful for his students in the future."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,none
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,N/A
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,assigned homework that was not just regurgitating information but was applicable and challenging
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,very good professor
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,It has not.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,taught me how to use math to solve business problems
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,make slides easier to read
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He encourages learning but he doesn't test and grade his students in a fair way
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The course itself was not what I thought. I didn't expect the class to include algebra and calculus.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He has not encouraged me at all if anything his incompetency has discouraged me to learn or try in his class. Every day I drive to class I hope I get hit just so I don't have to go.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Helped demonstrate tools on excel
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,It was kinda hard to follow the lectures when I had to sit I had to sit in the back.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He offered extra additional homework that was optional, and purely for our intellect and growth."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He has increased my interest in excel and its functions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,he was good
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He provided insight into how to handle real–life situations analytically.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Worked with Linear algebra
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"You really need to go over more examples in class in a more efficient amount of time. We would regularly only go over around 3 real questions per class, even during the text reviews. We should not be reviewing the basic step–by–steps of the problems during reviews, we should be practicing at the speed and quantity we would need to do them during the test, as that is what is expected of us. A criticism I've heard from multiple people is ""the lecture is useless, I only go to the recitation,"" and I believe what I have previously stated is the main reason."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"This class should not be a lecture, it should be problems assigned online and review material in class. Students cannot follow so assigning problems beforehand is a way to ensure they interact"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Had me learn a new tool used in the business field
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,challenging homework assignments
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,More homework
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Giving us in class examples and working through them helped
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Has taught me a lot about excel and finding out about optimizing certain situations.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He’s passionate about the subject, but it can be confusing for students to grasp exactly what we need to know"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,I love the way to solve problems with liner model.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,show me how important operations management is
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"I wish the professor was more organized with grading. There was always adjustments that happened after every exam and homework, where some students would get more points and some students would lose points. This made for a lack of transparency in understanding how we were being evaluated in the class."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"he only teaches one kind of question in the class, and then he asks us to solve other types of similar questions by ourselves, like solving the shadow price under different optimal points"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"I did like the way the questions were structured, made studying the material very straightforward."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Some of the course concepts have inspired me to apply them to real–world optimization problems. The skills I learned in this class will be really useful in my summer internships and future career.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,There were many errors especially when it came to grading the exams and my classmates as well as myself found it very inefficient.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,This class has not encouraged my intellectual growth. I am the type of student who studies and works hard but I feel like the material was not explained well and that the way the professor explains concepts were confusing
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,I do not think the instructor has encouraged my intellectual growth and progress.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,NOT
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The instructor provided numerous examples for each type of problem which allowed students to practice material outside of class.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He taught us Linear Programming, which is useful."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,drop it
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"good professor, learned a lot about Ops Mgmt."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,By being a good teacher
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"Difficult to understand. Sped through topics, not thorough"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,No comment
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Used homework questions as a way of assessing our understanding of the material we have learned throughout the semester.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"Very bad at conveying the material, never understood what he was saying so discouraged me from even attending to class."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Romulu is the man. Excellent professor. I had no prior knowledge in this course and this man taught me a great deal. Very appreciative of all his efforts
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Very motivated
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He has been awesome and so helpful
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He assigned an extra credit project that was worth no additional points.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"Prof. Romulo is a good instructor, he just needs to do something to make it easier to understand him in the large class."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,more clear slides and more frequent practice hw with less material but spread out through the course would help.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He showed up to class
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The material was pretty interesting
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"Sensitivity analysis, simulations and graphs"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,none zero nada
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,no.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Tough hw
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,I was more interested in using Excel.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,none
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Helped me think things through
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"During the beginning of the course, Professor Ely was very good. He made sure that he did all the problems on the board but after the first exam he started to explain problems instead of writing them out. His grading was very unfair as there were many mistakes in his homework and exams and he is very slow with changing grades. His homeworks were very easy until the last homework which was very hard and irrelevant to his exams. Lastly, he had the last homework assignment, the second exam and the final exam within the span of one week which was very unfair. The TA's very were helpful in helping me understand the material, because at some point he was very confusing."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He has not
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,none
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Good
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"I always feel confused and out of the loop about what will be on the homework or on the exams in this class. The material is
straightforward but I found that I, along with most other students, did not think that the material was taught in a straightforward way.
We were left confused most of the time, and the only answer we got was to go to office hours or study the homework. We spent hours studying the homework and felt more than prepared for the exam, but there were many questions that were neither taught in lecture nor in recitation. Therefore, our grades did not reflect our knowledge on the subject. My recommendation is to just stick to putting the material that we learned on the exams, rather than adding questions that the students are seeing for the first time ever on the exam."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,nasdljfn
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,he has not.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,This course has encouraged my intellectual growth by giving me a comprehensive understanding of the way things work in a business. I learned a lot of material that gave me new insights into business operations and also reinforced material I had learned in my other business courses.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Not at all.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The homework helps with studying for the exam
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He hasn't
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,None
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,no
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He is very passionate about this course I feel.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"The course itself is interesting, id say the information on the power point along with the real world examples encouraged my intellectual growth – Romulo is a funny guy"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Make teaching the Excel files less complicated and more clear
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Work on responding to students and TA and help students that don’t know how to use Excel
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Not much but I know he knows a lot of info about this subject
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,His teaching style doesn’t work well
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,N/A
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"I loved your way of teaching things. You made the material as realistic as possible. It was a pleasure taking this course with you. It was sometimes hard to focus on what you were teaching because of how cute you were. Therefore, I recommend for you to be less cuter for future semesters. It would help your students focus more on the material rather then your pretty face. I will be bold and tell you my name. I loved everything about you."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,I'm sure that If I was not in the big lecture that I would have been more intellectually engaged.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,boooooooo
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He hasn't
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,It was just hard to follow the content of the course when going between writing on the projector and excel. I got lost quite a bit.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The teaching style is amazing and has helped to gain the knowledge of random numbers and different topics covered during the coursework.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The professor demonstrated a lot of passion for the material and for the overall learning of his students.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"Whatever career skills this class is preparing me for, i now know that i have absolutely no desire to do it"
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,"He offered additional homework problems to do online, allowing me to explore my curiosity."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,respond to forum questions and more worked out solutions
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,a better understanding of OPS
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,He is passionate about the topic so he makes it a little more interesting since the material can be dry. The jokes along the way always make it better.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,Didnt as I didnt go

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,This course was challenging for me and taught me to work extremely hard to do well
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,growth,The tests and the homework assignments were challenging. Required me to think about each problem.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,I think the only issue I had with the class was during the second midterm. Since the classroom in the large class is so small and crowded it was extremely difficult to have multiple papers and not being able to write on the test. This made it very easy to transpose numbers which would be a major issue. This made me very anxious during the test and I feel I could have done much better if the set up was not this way.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"It was really hard to follow along in class especially when we are working out the solution and the professor has to keep flipping
back and forth in pages.
Recitations are really helpful, it is mostly where I learn the materials.
I really dislike how the homeworks are formatted. If I realized a mistake later on in the homework, I couldn't go back to change the
answer. Also, for homework 4, because of how the questions are randomized, I end up having to reopen and edit my excel like 3
times since I closed it thinking it was done.
There are also not enough time for the exam since most of them require calculation and not to mention that seatings are really tight and so are the desks, which makes the whole exam really uncomfortable to take."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,better slides
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,Instructor intentionally tries to trick students on tests with extremely hidden details that can alter answers. Tests do not do a good job at testing knowledge of material.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"The actual course materials were interesting but I had a hard time understanding the purpose of certain math procedures solving certain problems. also, your handwriting was illegible most times. I think there were other times that you went off topic. I loved the comedic breaks in between things but I thought we spent too much time on certain topics that, when going over in recitation, took only a few minutes for me to understand. I also wish you could go over the excel part slower. A whole homework was based off of using excel solver yet we did not have enough practice with it and it isn't even on any of the exams."

There were way too many lines and shadings and it was all so disorganized so many people could not follow along during lecture. It was hard to even figure out what we were supposed to be learning until studying on our own and talking to tons of people to try to piece the class together. I hardly understand what operations management is and I am a BAIT major so this is disheartening. Overall the class could have been interesting but outside factors took away from it a lot. Romulo seems like a nice guy but teaching wise there needs to be more effort to help because this is confusing stuff to learn for the first time.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,This class was really disorganized on test days. Different sections in recitations learned different things. I really did not enjoy this class at all.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,The last homework is unnecessarily hard. The homework should let us move on to other problems when we can't solve it. It should let us come back to the hard problem but it doesn't let us do that.

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,the instructor did not do a good job in telling us what exactly to study and each lecture had too much content in it for students to actually understand what was going on
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"He was great though, really tried to make sure we all understood the material."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"This professor has very poor communication skills. He is lacking in care for his students and is difficult to reach when asking questions or stating he hasn't posted HW the date he said he would. He does not read his emails. He does not know how to teach in a lecture hall and does not understand the material that he is teaching. He is an awful, unorganized professor."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"The way this course is structured is terrible. This course should be structured more like Management Information Systems. Have smaller classes and a large number of sections. I know this makes scheduling much more complicated for RBS but I think students will learn much more effectively. I think if students were required to learn in this type of environment it would require students to come to class, just like MIS, and result in a better student to teacher ratio. Learning linear programming in a lecture hall with over 200 people does not work out, as you can see from the percentage of students who attended. Most students just go to recitation to learn the material in a smaller setting because in lecture hall most students get distracted with electronics, friends etc. And since most college students have the attention span of a five year old, a smaller classroom would be much better. And in reality, it did not pay to go to lectures because after going to his lectures I felt more confused. I think Professor Ely is very smart and knows what he is doing of course, but I do not like the way he teaches. If I had a question about something he would respond by explaining it and if I didnt get it the first time he would say ""guys its very simple"" and then look at me like that response was suppose to answer my question. Another problem is the way his slides are made. They do a great job at mirroring what is in the textbook but sometimes he doesn't highlight certain concepts in the slides that he later on tests us on. Going back to class size, throughout the semester I could tell that Professor Ely was very stressed due to the number of courses he was teaching. If RBS continues to have a large lecture hall for this course I would recommend adding a 2nd or 3rd teacher if possible. Because there were many mistakes that happened between HW assignments and exams this semester and I think it was mainly because Professor Ely had too much on his plate. If you can have two other individuals that students can go to for help then I think it would take some pressure off of him. Now on to the TA's. My TA overall was okay, but in general there was a very large discrepancy between what TA's were teaching students and what Processor Ely was. When it came to the 8 LP modeling examples most TA's only taught the first 6 problems because they said the other two were never on the exam. Later when it came time for the exam they found out that they may be on it so then they rush to teach it to us. This is not fair to the students because the purpose of learning this material is to actually learn it and be able to increase our ability to model, not for purpose of passing a exam. There really needs to be better communication between Professor Ely and his TA's because its the student who suffers in the end. Also, overall my TA was smart and very helpful. But I found at times they were not prepared for class and were trying to remember how to do problems on the fly. And many of the their lectures were not aligned to what we were learning in class (Example: were were learning lecture 5 in class, but in recitation we were still on lecture 4) "
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"its nerve racking having your grade posted and checking it a day later to find its changed. Some students are unsure if they are exempt from the final 3 days before it. Get organized, be more prepared, and don't let it get to the point where students are nervous that their correct answer will be marked wrong on an exam. If I hadn't received A's on both exams I would have definitely argued against your answer key. Though I remain unaffected by your exam grade changes – do YOUR homework and assure the same problems won't persist next semester."

S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"The communication between the TA's and the intructor should be better, some TA's dont know any critical information for the students and at recitation they cannot answer student questions. There are also students who go to other recitations because they TA may not be able to answer questions. During exams students have many questions and not enough TA's to help clarify. The exams have many mistakes which could definitely effect results for students."
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,Giving the TA's more problems to go over during recitation would likely be helpful practice for us. Also moving the second exam up so it's not a week before the final would also be beneficial. My class has the second exam in two days and we have yet to review for it because we have been reviewing for the final and have only covered the stuff from the first exam so far.
S2019-largeclass,2019,Spring,other,"If the average on the first exam is a 78, that should be a pretty big red flag that the exam was badly written. Especially since it was only 20MC and no partial credit. Just let us write on the exam, bluebooks just make it more inefficient for us when we take exams, which I feel like is really counterintuitive in an OPERATIONS class."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,recitation 
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,I think recitation was more helpful than lecture due to going through shorter problems step by step instead of longer ones that we will not be tested on. 
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,Easy to understand the material
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,I like that in recitation we have time to actually review the material as opposed to just a lecture

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,This the most straightforward business class I have taken. 
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,"I did not have prior interest in this course nor did this course generate any interest to me. If I had to pick one thing I like about this course, it would be the recitation sessions."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,I like that he thoroughly went through examples in class and shared the examples' corresponding Excel files with the students.

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,The usage of excel and learning how to actually utilize the tools within it.
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,best,The recitation class was my favorite part of this course. Shaye was a great resource the entire semester
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"I would have more notes on the powerpoint. The slide deck was just filled with examples and not actual notes. Therefore going to do homework about concept
questions was difficult because there were not many concepts on the slides"
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,I would encourage students to take part in an extra credit opportunity.
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Nothing
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"At times I think he does not explain the problems as concisely or clearly as it could be. I would suggest he should refine the slides that its easier to understand for
the students and for himself. He understands the material, but teaching it seems to not be his strong suit. I also would like if he could let his TAs hold office hours,
so students can go over exams and homework, rather than just come to him for everything."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Nothing
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"The lectures weren't very effective and I learned a lot more from the recitation sessions. Problems weren't clearly explained or we jumped around a lot.
Especially for the last bulk of the material, there was a lot of confusion."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,I would focus more on real-world applications of the material.
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Weight Homework less, and place more emphasis on recitation/exams."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Our professor changed grades several times after putting them in the gradebook, giving students the idea that they were doing better/worse than they actually
were."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Move quicker in class. The classes tended to drag on and only go over one problem
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,No

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,put more into the slides than just the textbook shortened - more solutions less qualitative

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,SMALLER CLASSES

answer to it, and it confused me."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,I would have smaller classes with just the TAs instead of the big lectures.

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,N/a
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,add different modes of understanding informatino
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"The homeworks should be assigned after all of the material that is asked on the homework is covered in the lectures. This will allow for a better opportunity for
students to get better grades on the homework assignments."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,everything and would properly teach
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Make the powerpoints a little more in depth, I find myself referring to the textbook sometimes to fill in the gaps that you miss while reviewing the powerpoint
problems."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Maybe not spend so much time on one problem in the lecture
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"I would like to have more practice problems that aren't solved during lectures. This would allow students to practice the problems on their own without help and
they can check their work with an answer sheet."
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Ability to choose which recitation to go to

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,N/A
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,Class is so SLOW. Speed it up. I can guarantee 90% of the students would agree with me.
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Well, I felt like his lectures was time wasted. He would go over 1 problem per class, and the powerpoints he used only had the problem, but no direction,
protocol or solutions. He should've presented more of the information instead of just doing problems... because that severely limits out understanding to just those
problems."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,More graded homework
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,I would create lesson plans for the TAs so each week the recitation aligns with the lecture and so all TAs are teaching the same examples and information
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"class was very short, 55 minutes not enough for lecture"
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,I would do more examples in class rather than relying on the TAs to teach the examples.
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Make the class more engaging, no one attends"
F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"I would ask questions from the slide and then answer them concisely and then teach it a bit slower. It kind of feels like the professor is ranting or talking to
himself sometimes, and a lot of the problems do not have solutions on the slides."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Have a more structured recitation and lecture. Some recitations were repetitive of the same concepts gone over in lecture. I would structure the recitations to

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"I would change the formatting of the online homework. For example, I did not like how on the platform we did homework on, we were unable to skip around
through questions and we could not revisit something after already moving on to the next question. I think this was unrealistic and unfair, and there are multiple
other platforms for online homework and tests I have used at Rutgers that let students revisit questions."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,change,"Students were providing each other answer guides in order to do better on the homeworks towards the end of the course. I found this unfair because I did not
have access to those answers and therefore they did better than I did. Additionally, the format of the exams was a learning curve. 20 questions is not a lot to test
such a large amount of material per exam. Additionally, the instructor was unpleasant during office hours and did not provide clarification on mistakes on exams.
His attitude reflected that he was just going to sit there and supervise and not provide instruction on how to do better. I rate the quality of this professor and
curriculum at mediocre at best. I will still do well in the course, but for future students, I am sure they will struggle with this professor and course much more than
they should if things remain the same."

F2018-largeclass,2018,Fall,growth,"I had Romulo Ely in the past for a Byrne seminar. He is so awesome, I really admire him because he's passionate about what he knows, and doesn't just blindly
present information like other professors do at Rutgers. This is essential in inspiring student learning because if the professor doesn't present passion, than the
student's with lack that engagement as well. Romulo is an awesome guy."

F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,Upload video lectures.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,"Recitations should be MANDATORY for every session. Lecture is useless. Romolo is a very intelligent person, but the class layout is pathetic. Over reliance on
excel which is not reflected in exams. Excel problems are extensive and used on homework, which is difficult because following what the professor does on excel
is impossible"
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,"I would show more work on the slides and provide sample practice problems for the test formats. It's always unclear what the questions will be like in multiple
choice format on all of the tests."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,I will put the group project
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,"Everything. Not a single way or method he used to teach was effective. Wasted more time going to this class that I could have spent reading the textbook and
learning myself than going to this class. PowerPoints were ineffective, in-class notes and material on the board were not detailed nor helpful in explaining
anything that students could have used."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,Be more effective in engaging students and explaining what will be on the exams.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,change,Add more practice problens

F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,It helped me strengthen my logical problem solving skills.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"By engaging with class though providing enough material that students can understand thoroughly so they can take something away from the class and use it in
real life when needed."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,Problems solved in class have helped me understand better and progress.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,He has encouraged me to study hard and practice problems over and over until I get familiar with the concepts.

F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,At first the professor did lots of examples at first and that was really helpful.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"He always worked examples, asked our opinions and explained to us when we give a wrong answer to a scenario."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,More in-depth excel knowledge
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"In a lot of ways, yes. Professor cares a lot about students for sure."

F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,learnt about real world problems
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"yes, i am better at solving problems about operation management"
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,It gave me a strong knowledge about operations management
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"He is really nice, and helpful. I think he teaches it in a way that makes us more able to understand. Open to questions and seems to want to see us succeed"
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,I better see the connection with math and the business world and the importance and pervasiveness of it
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,Use of excel and simulation.

F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"Yes, to use the course material to study"
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"Probably made this entire semester more stressful overall. The amount of time and work needed to review the material that the professor didn't teach well in
class was a detriment to my physical and mental health as well as hindering my intellectual growth and capabilities in all my other classes."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,To understand how to work through problems given certain limits.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,In a lot of ways
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,"Questions, thoughts, and other topics discussed in class were very ambiguous. Provide more detail when going over answers to question. Do not just say and
then you do this, and then not show the answer."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,growth,By challenging us through this lectures.
F2018-21,2018,Fall,other,"maybe try cut down the points for each question in the exam,5 is way too much for people to make minor mistake when they actually know the answers"

F2018-21,2018,Fall,other,"Every class should have a recitation. The recitation teachers teach a lot better than the professor and give all their students hints. My section did not have a
recitation TA. I started going to another classes TA and my grade improved tremendously. Being in the class without a recitation TA put students at a huge
disadvantage and it is not fair at all. I bet there is is a clear difference in grades between the sections with TAs and without."
F2018-21,2018,Fall,other,"Great class, interesting material. Professor is down-to-earth and humorous, which I sincerely appreciate. Very realistic and sociable which is a breath of fresh air

just be set up and not solved, so when I would need help to complete the homework problems I wouldn't know how. At first I though it was me taking poor notes,
but when I compared with a friend in different section, she had the same thing. One of the most useful things that the professor posted was the steps and solutions
to completing problems on powerpoints. However, he only did this for the first midterm."

F2018-21,2018,Fall,other,"High probability of being the worst professor I've ever had to take in a class. Has a strong accent which makes learning difficult, wouldn't be as bad if he gave
proper notes in class on either the board or the PowerPoints. Sometimes sounds like he has no idea what he's doing at all whatsoever cause he stares at Excel for a
good 5 minutes before showing the next step. I'd read the textbooks to get a grasp of the lesson beforehand but leave the classroom confused and to be honest
more than annoyed. I felt my time was wasted attending lectures when the professor didn't teach well, wasn't prepared, and couldn't explain processes. While I
didn't do as well as I had hoped, where I am partially to blame, I do believe that having this professor made everything much more difficult as in I did not have a
path to success whatsoever."

F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,professor is perfect
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The professor. He was really caring and understanding and quite approachable. Rutgers did well with this guy

F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,Really kind and works well with students.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,Made me think more than I usually do for other courses
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,"I really liked the amount of work given. It was manageable, and relevant to real life scenarios."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The ability to effectively prepare for the exams with the material given to us.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The professor was very friendly and was very considerate of students. He always made sure he was available and answered questions clearly.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,"I like how clear and structured the course is. I know what to expect and what to study and there's a lot of clarity from professor. Also, I appreciate the speed and
pace of the class. The professor really takes his time going through each problem which is extremely helpful in terms of learning the material."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The professor is willing to help no matter what the circumstances.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,"Hands down best prof I’ve ever had in RU. I am ass at computers and understanding a lot of numbers this man broke it down perfectly. Failed the first Midterm
and he helped me out so much in class just taking his time explaining and I got a 90 on the second midterm. His teaching style is amazing."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,Learning different methods and playing with Excel
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The homework problems really helped me understand the concepts that were taught.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,the professor
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,"Professor Ely was a very knowledgeable professor and did a lot of examples in class so everything was very thorough. He was very friendly and explained things
well"
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,"it gives interesting approaches to try different situations professor always prepared, links material to real wold situations"
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,I like the real life examples that were used in this course that were helpful to understand the theory and the concepts
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,Romulo is the man
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The professor really tries to help his students
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,The professor's genuine interest in the students. Making sure we understand the material
F2018-20,2018,Fall,best,It is helpful for future studies on business
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"The exams seem to cover a lot of core concepts, but in class we learn a lot about understanding how to solve the problems. Maybe having the focus of the exams
and the class to be similar so that we are more prepared for the exams."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"make lecture more interesting, make the points clear, sometimes I don't understand what is going on until I self-teach myself with youtube videos."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"the matter is just awful. instrucor amazing and defintedly cares about his students. this is someone who should be teaching this course. unlike the dean who
teaches over the summer I have never in my life experienced so much misery in my life, had to end up with a W because the suppose ""dean"" who is there to helps
and guide student student to succeed was more interested in failing you. so much misery."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,Better study guides they were just a bit vague
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,I would provide more questions that help understand how to do homework. I would also go over homework problems in class.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,The professor often cancelled office hours and was hard to get in contact with and the HW was very hard
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"Lecture is pretty boring, maybe make some more examples to work on for the exam"
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"Improve the lectures and include more recitation work/notes in them (this was a 3 hour lecture every week, no recitation)."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"The professor was not responsive via email. I sent multiple follow up emails and received no response. I wanted to make an appointment for office hours since
his hours did not fit with my work schedule and the professor made no accommodations to try to help me when I was reaching out for help regarding my first
exam grade. I would suggest for the professor to be more available to students when they are seeking help. I would also focus less on excel in the lectures as it
does not pertain to the material we are being tested on."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"My session did not have a recitation, and I feel material was covered more thoroughly in the recitations."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"Solved problems on excel vs. problem setup on excel. Also, a detailed guide on how to set a problem up in excel."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,nothing
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,More practice problems
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,I would not have the final worth so much.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,I would eliminate any of the complementary material that was not integral to completing homework assignments and preparing for exams.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"The professor focused a great deal on using Excel, but the exams were written, multiple choice. I would have preferred if they way the professor taught and went
over the material matched how the exams were given."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"Please please please reconsider allowing students to go back on previous questions on the homeworks. In tests and quizzes, students have the ability to go back
and correct any mistakes they make and I feel like we should be able to do that on the homework. Sometimes later questions help students understand previous
questions and it can be extremely helpful, especially considering homework is a significant part of the grade."

like."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,i'd make final exam worth less % or not cumulative
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"I would try to make it more dynamic, a three hour class can be very long and tedious and if it is only going through slides it can not be as effective"
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,Some questions on HW are unclear or too vague. PPT's could be more detailed in explaining how you do certain things.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,Nothing at all
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,"Not sure, the material itself is difficult to understand so what the professor is doing now is okay."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,change,NO

F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,It has showed me the importance of excel.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,This course has encouraged me to further enhance my skills in Excel and to learn more of its functionalities.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,The professor always made sure we understood how this would have been used in the real world.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,"Using real world examples in exercises and applying the course material to real world problems. This showed how useful this course material is within many
industries."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,I really appreciated the examples on excel. I feel like it could easily be applicable in a professional and real-world setting.
F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,I have become better on the material covered

F2018-20,2018,Fall,growth,"I do have a better understanding of operations management once Prof. Romulo explains, sometimes he needs to explain twice but he takes his time and does not
give up until we all understand. He also very accommodating with his office hrs."

F2018-20,2018,Fall,other,"Write the tests so that, if possible, the entire question is on one page. It is annoying to keep switching back and forth to see all the answers. Also, do you really
have to limit the number of people who can be in your office at one time to 3? It is annoying that we have to wait."
F2018-20,2018,Fall,other,"Maybe word things easier. Sometimes the concepts are hard to grasp so if things were explain slower and dumber, more students will be able to understand"

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,"I liked that the professor was very interactive and cared about his students. Even if we took 30 minutes going over one problem, he made sure that everyone

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,"It's pretty simple math, not much to learn besides some vocabulary words so that's nice"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,I enjoy the material.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,"The professor seemed like he really wanted students to understand the material. It was also nice of the professor to put all the solutions to the example problems

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,Interesting
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,"It provided me a brief understanding of what kind of stuff BAIT Major does. It is a class that requires you to understand the concept and helps improve on one's
ability in excel, especially since business majors are going to be using excel often."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,Prof was cool and nice
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,I really appreciated how the exam problems reflected the examples presented in class on the PowerPoint presentations.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,"The professor was open to student recommendations and tried to make the course about the overall learning experience rather than just learning for the exam. I
really appreciated that along with his passion for the material."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,The relaxed manner of the professor
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,Everything!

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,It was easy
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,The material was very interesting
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,No stress
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,We learned how to use excel for most of the operations so that we might be able to use it in a real world situation in the future.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,professor

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,loved working with excel
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,best,the Ta and the professor were always available
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,N/A - Professor was great
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Give more practice to the students. Also his way of uploading documents to blackboard was rather misleading and wasn't really that easy to follow.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,prepare better for the exams
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,N/a
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would have problems with step by step solutions to create an easier way for students to understand the process of getting the solutions.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,N/A
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would make it a lot more clear as to what's going on as I often felt it was very unorganized.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,More actual use of solving problems on excel
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Better exam review classes, going over more practice problems, posting solutions for practice problems."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would not have given the first exam on the computer
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would have more interactive lectures and offer attendance as extra credit in order to boost involvement.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would spend a few more classes explain the immediate connection of the course to the applicable business world
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Refer to other post
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,engage the students more. do more problems in class and explain each part step by step
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Maybe focus towards more exam-like material. Sometimes I didn't know what to study
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would probably go over the concepts a little more. In class, we spent a lot of time doing practice problems, which was so helpful, however sometimes, the
concepts got a little confusing until I went home and read the textbook."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,rg
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,teach to the students not the materil
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Engage student more often
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Teach it more clearly.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would make attendance mandatory and assign clicker questions throughout the lecture to make the class more engaged, i feel as if students retain more
information that way."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Did not attend lecture
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would actually give more homework (or at least more practice problems). Doing these on my own, in addition to lecture and recitation, really helped me
understand the material. Also, be a little bit more clear about how we'll be tested on excel"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"If I were teaching this course, I would bring in examples from the news or Wall Street Journal and tie them into the curriculum."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Make the material more relatable to business.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Yes, I would give sample questions, a lot, for students to continue practicing and understand how to get the right results."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,He mad no sense during class. Made everything more difficult then it needed to be.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"More examples, the exams are difficult"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would add more opportunities for students to demonstrate their knowledge. I feel that there aren't enough homework questions and exam questions. This course
is essentially weighted from 100 multiple choice questions. The margin for error is little to none."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Spend more time explaining logic and wording than math
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,none
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Maybe give more explanation to the questions.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nope
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Smaller classes
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,not have the first midterm on computer
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,have recitation as an option
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would assign more homework.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,more homework
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I wouldn't do anything differently.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,It would be helpful if you can go back to previous questions for the HW
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Make the material more organized and understandable.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would not teach using excel/solver when we are not allowed to use that on exams. I would try and divert the methods to a more practical method so that we are
better prepared for exams."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"The way he explains concepts is very confusing and unclear. The textbook provides much clearer examples and outlines exactly what you need to do in order to
solve a problem. The homework is also extremely difficult compared to the problems he goes over in class – it is also unfair that you cannot review your
homework answers before submitting (the system locks your grade in as soon as you click ""next""). There have been countless times that the more I solved
homework problems, I realized a mistake I made 2 problems ago and it was very frustrating that I was not able to go back and change this answer - especially
since homework is worth as much as an exam. I think this policy should be changed."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Lack of solutions in the presentations.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I wouldn't have made midterm 1 so different for each section.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"teach smaller sections, better TAs"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,i would format the class differently because it is very tempting to skip class since there would be no repercussions for doing so.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would create more homeworks. In my opinion, 4 home work assignments was not enough to learn the information taught in this course."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,more review more homeowork
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would have the slide decks be a little more detailed only because if you miss something in class that is not on the slides it is hard to figure something out
sometimes."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,more organization
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,post the solutions to slides!
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would split it up into smaller class sizes. I went to a couple of the 8:40 section classes and it was much easier to learn in a smaller setting than in the lecture
hall."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,more exercise about the class material.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would not do anything differently. 
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Give better, more informative slides"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,n/a
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would the lecture size smaller, I do not think this class should be a 400 person lecture."

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Keep the exams paper based since taking it on the computer was a hassle.

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,drop the lowest grade
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,smaller sections.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Make a semester schedule and adhere to it more, specifically homework assignments. Having homework assignments randomly and having short windows(2
days) isn't a reasonable amount of time. "
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would definitely give more time between exams. We would often cover material the Monday before our exam (on Wednesday), and its definitely not enough
time to get a full understanding of the material."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Format the course documents more efficiently so everything is easy to find.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I wouldn't copy the textbook word for word on the slides. If I were to copy the textbook onto the slides, I would include all the necessary information from the
textbook problems on the slides instead of leaving missing pieces. I would also allow backtracking on the homework assignments, and I would have the exams on
paper."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"For the HW, let students backtrack. please"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would not put as much emphasis on homework.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would be more organized both in class and on our Blackboard site. I feel that there were too many useless files on the Blackboard site that we didn't even use
and made it more tedious to find the actual course material. The instructor was also a little disorganized in how he presented the material and some of the concepts
were unclear in the classroom."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Explain important cnocepts more thoroughly
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would rearrange the lecture and make the PPT more readable
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would go in more debts in class and answer students questions without going too fast
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,No blackboard quizzes/midterms
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"The course should be flipped, with an additional recitation and one less lecture. It is easier to learn the material in smaller groups when more people can
participate and ask questions. Unfortunately, there's no way to do this in such a large lecture hall."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would make the slides more informative and easier to understand and read. Include the actual question on the slide so that when you look back to study, you
can actually do the practice problems from the slides."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Make the material more accessible
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would give more review problems
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would try to speak clearer along with trying to use a more organized method in showing the layout of the problems because the way it is taught in lecture with
writing on the screen software is very messy. "
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,little hard to understand at times and maybe speak a little slower. also issues with grading that were never fixed and points were supposed to be given back
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,no online exams
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,yes
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Everything was good so would not change much
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Add the questions onto the slides
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I stopped going because your accent was too hard to understand, but you can't change that."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Show more examples on the board instead of just talking it through
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"more recitation like process in lecture, instead of going through powerpoint"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would highlight the concepts and go over practice problems of the types of questions that would be on the exam. Try to explain the terms and definitions so the
class can have a better understanding. It is hard to follow the powerpoint slides where it is hard to see what is being shown."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Go at a slightly faster pace, review of previous class concepts at the start of the new class for at least 5 min."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I wil teach the course in effective way, that is to illustrate the concept and solutions of the problem more clearly."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Recitation just went over the same problems in the lecture presentations, at some point you notice that if you go to one then you don't learn anything new by
going to the other."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would implement an online exam that involves using Excel.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,less reliant on powerpoints
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would give extra credit to students who actually attend lecture. Maybe even throw in an extra credit question on the exam that only people who attended and
paid attention in lecture would be able to answer."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Maybe more exercises.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Nothing
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Have us be allowed to go back to the previous questions when doing hw
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,Have more homework assignments so students have more material to practice and prepare for the exams.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,no cumulative final
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,More examples on slide
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Mandatory attendance, and change up lectures"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I do not think I would have done anything differently. The use of examples was very helpful for doing the homework and tests.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would have a review class before exams and not have any classes in a big lecture hall.
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,cancel lectures and have recitations only
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"homeworks had extremely confusing questions, allow students to look back at previous questions on hw assignments, encourage students to buy book (it was
very helpful)"
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"I would allow the students to be able to go back during homework. It was really frustrating knowing that you could not fix the homework problems once you've
moved on."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,I would focus more on what material would be on the exams and just be slightly more clear when doing problems

grading process."

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"DO NOT have the class in such a large lecture room. I would prefer small classes twice a week for 80 minutes instead of two 55 minute classes and a 55 minute
recitation. It breaks up the flow of learning the material and it's harder for the professor to address questions. Make homework assignments easier by allowing us
to go back to old questions, and don't set a time limit. That makes it more of a quiz than homework."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,not all of the practice problems so i would post the solutions to all practice problems because its useless to do the practice if you cant see if youre doing it right
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Prof. Romulo should do more to inform his TA's. His blackboard material NEEDS to be organized scattering documents across the page confuses students and

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,change,"Nothing really - since the professor is already providing several examples for the students to learn from and with the answers. (Besides in the first few chapters, I
feel like he should have some explanation on the slides with the graphs)"

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,other,"The exams wasted so much paper and you had to keep flipping to read the rest of the question on the next page because the spacing was done all wrong. Save the
trees, save us the thumb fatigue (lol). I heard a student had no clue what thumb fatigue meant so maybe putting jokes in the questions isn't helping those guys
out."

homework so that one bad grade won't affect your grade so much would be helpful. It would also be nice if we could go over our answers for homework. Being
locked out and not knowing what we did right or wrong wasn't helpful. Overall, I know this class has a lot of potential but I had a hard time trying to grasp the
subject."

exact same material in a quicker amount of time."

S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,other,"I feel bad because the professor is such a nice guy and I understand he was hurt throughout the semester, which limited him to walk a lot of the time. However, it
seems to me that we were not given enough time to complete each homework assignment. It is very difficult to be given a homework assignment which can take
hours to complete and be given only about 2-4 days to complete it. I am a student taking 18 credits and it was very difficult to manage this. Also, this class cannot
be taught in such a large capacity, it is too difficult to manage this many students especially when there are so many ongoing issues throughout the semester
related to technology."
S2018-largeclass,2018,Spring,other,none
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,"I like operations in general. The book was very helpful in understanding the class material. I REALLY liked that attendance was optional, as I still went to all of
the classes except two - but I did not feel pressure that my grade would suffer because of snow or because I got sick."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,The code and logic is really helpful in real life.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,He means well and is nice.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,What I like best about the course was how the professor was available to answer questions for students
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,"I like that we had the option to take this class as a 55, 80, or 180 minute long sections."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,He is very kind and easy to approach with any questions you may have related to homework and exams.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,the professor
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,I enjoyed how enthusiastic the professor was every day coming to class. It made it easy to pay attention in class.

S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,The material is very quick to understand.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,"Although the material is somewhat difficult to understand, Professor Ely would always provide a great explanation for the topic that week. I highly enjoyed the
lectures as they were very thorough and detailed. Also, if a student was having trouble with a certain problem, he would always answer them in a respectable
manner."

S2018-21,2018,Spring,best,The professor is nice and it's not that difficult while still being interesting/valuable
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,"I would include additional OPTIONAL practice problems that were similar to the HW and what would be on the test. While we went through problems in class,
the homework/tests were stressful because we had only one example from each option. I went in to taking tests thinking I was very good at setting up problems
and understanding the material, then I would get a bad grade on the test. Also, I would offer once or twice extra credit for doing Excel solver"
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,Explain problems better
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,the homeworks were difficult took a few hours and everything is worth alot of points
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,"I would make the class more engaging and less confusing when it came to exams and homework. I would also keep it more organized and try to do my best to
stay on schedule."

explain excel."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,"Switch up the Homework grading, there was an assignment where points were taken away."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,nothing i like the professor's way for teaching the class
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,I would make attendance mandatory
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,"Assign homework at the end of each chapter. By doing this, students could regularly do practice problems and know right away if they misunderstood what was
taught in class, rather than realizing it too late during the midterm exams."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,I would do more problems.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,Answer students emails when they are pertaining to time and date of exams since they were unclear.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,I would try to give more assistance on how to solve the homework problems in class.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,I would present more organized powerpoint presentations and less confusing wording on homework assignments.

excel sheet myself."

S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,I would add a recitation session every week even if each class is already 80 minutes.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,change,Nothing really
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,The professor is always helpful and provided clear explanations
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,"He taught a lot about what i did not know about operations management. I learned a great deal being in this course and not knowing that operations is very
important in the real world."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,He tries to answer questions thoughtfully.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,Made me start to realize that I must analyze and break down problems further then my assumptions at first glance.

S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,I believe Romulo Ely is a great addition to the business school as he offers a unique culture and career background compared to other professors.
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,"In order for me to be completely engrossed in a class, the instructor should be able to enjoy what they are teaching. Professor Ely demonstrated that perfectly. He
had the ability to teach the course well (especially at 8am in the morning), enjoy the lecture material as he taught it to the class, and yet still be very jovial."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,N/A
S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,Many examples in class to explain the concepts that we learned.

S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,"The professor was very approachable and friendly. He made himself an equal to the students rather than feel superior to us, which made me more inclined to
listen and respect him."

S2018-21,2018,Spring,growth,Its pretty interesting stuff
S2018-21,2018,Spring,other,"Professor Ely is a very good teacher, and I am glad he is teaching operations. I believe having one TA for both the early classes would be very beneficial for
answering questions, how to's and correcting papers."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,other,"slow down when speaking, you tend to rush through the material and then it becomes hard to understand especially since certain words are mispronounced and
write more clearly on the board."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,other,"I think if the professor makes a mistake for an answer on the homework, he shouldn't take points away from students. He should only change the grade if the
grade were to go up."
S2018-21,2018,Spring,other,all in all it is a pretty good course with a great instructor.

great and genuine soul! Wish he taught some of the classes that I'll be taking next semester!"
